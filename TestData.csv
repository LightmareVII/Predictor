Realistically, I don\'t think it\'ll stop these activities but I do think it would make it more difficult. \n\n>Either the price of immigrant labor will have to go up, or the supply will go down.\n\nCorrect, illegal immigrant supply would go down, but hopefully legal immigrant supply would go up.

I\'m all for helping refugees and letting them in through proper channels. Many of these refugees won\'t have to go through the terrible price of illegally crossing the border. (Old stats show up to 60% of women 14+ are raped/sexually assaulted illegally crossing). If the system is made easier for refugees to get here, they wouldn\'t have to illegally cross. \n\n>those who support the wall will get exactly what they claim they don\'t want - immigration made up mostly of those involved in illegal trafficking and asylum seekers, while losing much of the immigrant labor pool\n\nI disagree with this reasoning. I think a wall inhibits illegal activities. A wall doesn\'t completely close off immigration. Just illegal immigration and associated crime. The legal immigration system should be improved, for workers,  refugees, and people who wish to live here, making it faster and simpler for them to get here. But even as it is, I personally know refugees from Venezuela who made it here legally. So yes, it\'s possible.\n\n>But maybe they secretly want the wall for pure labor economics reasons\n\n""They"" being wall supporters?

Here\'s a brief, 4 year old Harvard Business Review article on the same subject that even uses the same language: https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-false-promise-of-the-single-metric\n\nAs an example, I\'m a software developer. I\'ve worked at a company before that held billable hours as their primary metric, because it translated directly to revenue. The result? Management was disincentivized to promote quality, best practices, training, preparedness for future projects, etc., and developers were incentivized to halfass things and drag projects out because we could charge more hours. This resulted in a catastrophic decline in customer satisfaction, and eventually we could no longer attract new customers, leading to layoffs. The company recovered when new management changed their approach to a holistic scoring method that accounted client satisfaction, developer satisfaction, efficiency, quality, billable hours, and future-proofing.\n\nOr to put it in a simpler way, focusing shareholder value as the exclusive metric of your business is a lot like focusing only on lowering your weight as the exclusive metric of your health.

crm4y3,Understanding Yield Curve Inversion,"Hello Fam, I'm noticing a lot of information and misinformation on yield curve inversion of US Treasury curve so I thought we should all do a quick exercise together to best understand how it all works.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",r/finance,1566048606.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/crm4y3/understanding_yield_curve_inversion/,t2_bk1uq,takeitor_leaveit,312,0.95,37,,False,276145,1,False,0,312,"{'ex6tuha': {'id': 'ex6tuha', 'body': ""This is solid all around, only thing i'd include is the main reason why yield curves are upward sloping is that there is more uncertainty in the future.

There are serious allegations in there (treating premiums as revenues and not building up any reserves), but it seems crazy to me that the problem would be as serious as described and completely overlooked by all people analyzing this company.\n\nIt\'s because the problem is significantly more complex than it appears on the surface.\n\nAccording to the report, the issue is that GE undervalued the LTC liabilities for many decades while average policyholder age was still young.  This is possible depending on the reserving assumptions used including lapse rates.  LTC has produced huge losses in the insurance industry, with one of the reasons being that LTC lapse rates were considerably lower than anticipated.  \n\nIf you expect, for example, half the policyholders to lapse before they reach peak LTC claim age, then your liability appears much lower.  But what happens when they don\'t lapse at this rate?  Well, the answer is that nothing immediately happens, especially if you don\'t update the reserving assumptions.  However, once the policyholders start going from healthy to disabled claimants, then the reserving basis switches from an active life reserve to a disabled life reserve, the latter of which is more difficult to ""game"" for a number of reasons.  Plus, you now have lots of money going out the door either way.\n\nInsurance accounting is complicated, but generally statutory rules are more straightforward - you recognize the actual cash flows in the period they occur.  GAAP allows deferral of acquisition expenses which can be used to ""smooth"" cash outflows, particularly in early durations.

While I don\'t follow GE regularly, I took a look at it today out of curiosity and these are my thoughts: There is no question that the company is WAYY over leveraged relative to its investment grade rating but the rating agencies STILL haven\'t downgraded it to junk, citing ""expectations for deleveraging"" which seem super optimistic IMO. \n\nSetting all the potential conflicts of interest and political factors aside, Rating agencies are hesitant to downgrade large blue chips like GE to junk because they are well aware it can trigger an even further downwards spiral in its ability to raise capital. GE relies heavily on investment grade corporate debt markets as well as commercial paper markets for financing, but its access to these markets would be shut down if downgraded to junk. GE would have to rely on the much smaller, more expensive High Yield markets, but with the vast amount of debt it has outstanding, it would be BY FAR the largest component of the High Yield bond index (~10%). No access to CP markets would mean working capital would likely need to be funded through ABS/securitization markets, which would put further pressures on liquidity. \n\nI question whether the HY markets can absorb all of GE\'s debt, especially with recession expectations on the horizon. The ability for GE to sell its non-core businesses at decent valuations (before a recession while they are still performing) and use proceeds to reduce debt will be key. If it can\'t right size the ship in time, I think Chapter 11 is a real possibility. \n\nGE is a microcosm of the downwards credit migration and systemic increase in financial leverage across corporations and governments.

Vacancy rates had reached their tightest levels of the cycle in the third quarter of 2007—office vacancy was 12.7% while industrial vacancy bottomed out at 7.7%. Shopping centers reached their nadir in vacancy at the same time, just below 8%. Then the rise began.\n\n> All three sectors peaked at their highest levels of vacancy in the first quarter of 2010, one quarter after the recession’s trough had passed, reaching 17.4% in the office property markets, 10.8% in the industrial market and 10.1% in the retail market. Deceleration that began in 2007 led an outright decline by 2009 in asking prices for vacant space with peak to trough asking rents falling by 8%, 16%, and 6% in the national office, industrial, and retail markets, respectively. Year-over-year rent decreases persisted for almost three years.\n\n> Slowly but surely, leasing activity picked up after the worst had passed, and those tenants were getting a deal. Between their low point in 2010 and today, asking rents have risen from $26.80 (office), $4.64 (industrial), and $16.63 (retail), by 24%, 25%, and 19%, respectively, all achieving record highs. The absorption rate of office space found its pre-crisis home around 195 square feet (sf) per worker. (The rate actually rose during the recession as employment declines outpaced firms’ ability to offload space.) Since demand turned positive in the second quarter of 2010, the national office market has tallied 380 million square feet (msf) of net absorption, the industrial market 1,450 msf, and shopping centers 300 msf. For the industrial sector, this had led to record-setting runs in leasing and new lows for vacancy. It has also meant that the swift rise in eCommerce has disrupted commercial markets, including warehouse and distribution networks, to a significant degree.
