lcjmb,"Four years ago, I opened up my own hedge fund during my last year of uni - AMA","A brief [intro](http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/l0woc/any_examples_of_small_time_traders_make_it_big_or/c2ozghq?context=3) in an earlier thread turned into a couple requests for an AMA. So, if anyone is interested, feel free to ask me some questions, and I'll try to take care of them this evening and whenever I check back in during the weekend.

The basic intro if you don't feel like opening the link:

> I started my hedge fund during my senior year of uni. Had just over 6 months trading with my own account before that, followed by another equivalent period of paper trading before that. Went to a decent school, known and reputable in the region but it's no Ivy.
I just celebrated my 4th year in the business.

I'm going to be super hesitant on providing any proof or discussing specific personal or some operational details. You're welcome to ask any questions you please, and I'll let you know if that's something I'll have to decline to answer, or I'll try to answer in a way that doesn't break any rules.

To start you off with a few basics:

* I now have three other guys in the firm with me, along with one intern. All three joined me around the same time two years ago. I picked the intern up this spring.

* AUM are between $1-100MM. Please don't ask for anything more specific in reference to this number.

* My fund is best described as multi-strategy fund. Futures, equities, FX on all exchanges are valid targets for us, as well as some OTC dealings.

cuuo6j,"Yooo get in here peeps, *State Of The Subreddit*, guidelines for political threads, and setting some aggressive penalties for violations - Discussion Thread. Speak now or forever hold your temp ban.","Alright guys, first I'm going to lay out my thoughts, feelings, and aim for the direction of this subreddit.  I've heard this echoed several times but I'll be blunt: the quality of discussion here has slipped over time, especially concerning anything that's remotely political.  My goal is to maintain a higher standard of investment discussion than your average financial subreddit (looking at you /r/personalfinance).  Obviously this is a general investing forum so we're open to all but I rarely see white papers posted anymore and I see a lot more stuff that isn't really that relevant to investing.  I personally have taken to removing these threads automatically - something like ""elon musk tweets that he wants to build an elevator to the moon by q12020 just isn't really investing news.  Sure it's interesting and funny, perhaps even newsworthy, but it's not something that really deserves to be on the front page of the subreddit.

So guidelines on corporate posts, /u/crasymike has guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I feel like these are very thorough and complete.  Feel free to weigh in here but I'm largely just reiterating what he said.  I think those are super good guidelines and I'm happy with the clarity it provides us in describing why we're removing threads that we don't think are investment related.  If anyone wants a real world example a lil bit back I removed a thread that was about BOA raising their minimum wage to $15/hr.  That's great news, it's definitely newsworthy somewhere, it's not relevant to investing.  Now if someone broke down staff costs for BOA and which percentage of those were low earning employees then in turn described how this would impact BOA's cashflow then perhaps it would have stayed.  But that wasn't the case.  Hopefully that provides some good clarity on what we're looking for here. 

So on to the big question mark.  We've been cracking down on this for months but I'd like to lay out some firm guidelines for political posts and comments.  Basically I'm going to mimic Mike's post above but also I want to discuss how we feel about aggressive enforcement.  First let me start by laying out my reasoning:

Anyone that's been slumming around this sub long enough remembers that it used to be a lot different when we were south of 400k subscribers.  Things change, that's fine.  But back then we had a higher percentage of industry professionals and more seasoned investors.  When politics came up most people weren't interested in the low effort mudslinging.  Most people here just stuck to discussing the investment aspect of something naturally, [here's a great example of a thread on Bernie's transaction tax in 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/40usw0/bernie_sanders_002_percent_financial_transactions/).  Now lets be honest, if that thread was posted today within 30 minutes the entire thread would be people arguing about socialism, student debt, boomers, Trump's haircut or skintone, really just about anything but the actual impact of transaction tax on markets.  And the rest would be ""why does bernie hate retirement funds"" or some other similarly low effort bullshit that displays absolutely no analysis.  That's bad.

Now, to be clear I believe we need harsher enforcement of comments in political threads than regular threads.  Lets be honest with ourselves, people personally identify with politicians and take personal offense to political attacks.  That's just the way it is.  Everyone is just so damn worked up and angry about politics.  If I say I think Jack Welch was a shitty CEO or that the management team over at Exxon is full of idiots I may have people disagree with me but it's not going to create a situation where some mob of Welch supporters starts calling me a fucking moron.  If I say Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders is an idiot then people are going to lose their shit.  So here's the thing: top and high level comments are key.  As much as I hate it people upvote these inflammatory comments, then people respond aggressively because they've been personally offended, then all of the sudden I can't actually discern /r/investing from the comments section of your local news station on facebook.  Seriously, if you ever want to feel like a genius go to the facebook comments on a local news article, any news article, really.  it's filled with complete idiocy.  That's what we're fighting, because if this is left unchecked all of the sudden this place looks like /r/politics or /r/the_donald and nobody wants that.  If you want those sort of posts then you can go there. 

So here's what I'm proposing, you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.

**Tied to investing:** This should be obvious but damn I can't tell you how many top level comments I remove concerning immigration, social rights, literally just people's disdain for [politician], how hard it is out there for millennials, etc.  you have to understand what your comment does, it attracts other comments that are discussing this subject and all of the sudden we've got a thread about manufacturing filled with comments discussing how it's hard to make a down payment on a house.  Look home ownership is nice but that's not topical and not related to investing. 

**Effort:** This is admittedly subjective but lets give some examples:

Bad: This is fucking stupid, why does bernie hate savers, MAGA!, Trade wars are easy to win right?, Orange man bad, lots of TDS here, Pocahontas just wants to tax your money away, Tulsi Gabbard's workout video on instagram is hot, [republicans/democrats/specific politican] hate america, etc.

Do these add to any sort of conversation in any manner?  No.

Good: ""Wow, I think Trump's recent move is pretty bad, China can do XYZ which will cause imports to go up/down and this is bad because ABC.""  or ""Trump is in the right here, with the current IP theft we need to take strong action, this will set us up for XYZ""  

these are both differing positions that people may agree/disagree with but you're making a good faith effort to have a discussion.  This is good. 

**Civility:**  I'm having a lot of people that don't post here a lot telling me that the current political climate warrants outrage and they need to be able to express that.  No you don't.  There's literally hundreds of politically oriented subreddits for you to go rant about how outraged you are.  You'll get plenty of upvotes and no crabby mods are going to ban you for shitting on their lawn.  True story.  I'm going to be completely honest: if people are not capable of discussing a topic that impacts investing without losing their shit and lobbing insults then they are not the sort of person we're catering to.  So lets quantify that too: 

Bad: this fucking idiot is going to ruin the country.  Bernie is a socialist and will ruin everything.  Trump is literally incompetent.  He's a criminal.  Republicans are literally just in it for their own self interest.  Democrats hate America.

Good: I definitely disagree with this approach, so far I'm not happy with this presidency because of [investment related XYZ].  I don't like [candidate] because of [investment related XYZ].  

I don't think it's too much to ask for everyone to not use this sub for their partisan word vomit.

**Now on to enforcement**

Here's my proposal, I haven't run this by anyone yet so I'm sure other mods will chime in and we'll all arrive at something together.  When I remove comments that don't fit in the conversation I check a lot of post histories.  95% of the time the people that come here to throw political haymakers never post here otherwise.  They often frequent political subs(yeah, news and worldnews count) and they are often the worst offenders with derailing conversation.  I kinda get it, maybe they subbed here but don't know anything about investing.  Investing can have a steep learning curve but everyone knows which politician they hate.  So, with the context that I intend to write up a long post of finalized posting/comment guidelines and combine that with the current corporate news vs investment news sticky, then have automod post a sticky to political threads imploring people read said guidelines BEFORE posting and that violating said guidelines results in an immediate ban I propose this:

If someone diverts conversation purposefully to political topics that aren't related, they post some low effort meme [MAGA, Orange man, TDS, any given trump insult, stable genius, trade wars are easy to win, Pocahontas, I'm sure I'm missing tons], or they just insult a politician overtly (think ""fucking idiot"" vs this isn't smart) then they're getting a 30 day ban.  

If they attack a person directly for their position, their post is a prolonged rant/personal attack against a politician/party, or they're being extreme about violating the above guidelines then they get a 60 day or possibly permanent ban depending on severity.  To be clear there have been some subjects that automatically get people permabans already.  Racism, homophobia, religious attacks(dude I swear someone asked about Sharia compliant investments and got insulted three times before someone answered), death threats, etc have warranted permabans already. 

My reasoning is simple: in my observation most of the toxic behavior comes from people who aren't contributing otherwise.  I don't really want them as subscribers.  I personally am fine with hurting our subscriber numbers if it means better more focused discussion.  

So thoughts?  have at it.

Other things I wanted to float that are tangentially related:  Possibly instituting character minimums for posts?  Either self posts or comments as well.  We might grant exceptions to regular contributors?  I really have absolutely no idea how or even if I could pull that off.  And I certainly don't know if it's a good idea.

Any other ideas?  Suggestions?  Have at it.",r/investing,1566660075.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/,MasterCookSwag,484,0.88,221,,True,789226,0,False,1,487,hot

2p8pxw,I just decentralized the entire $1.4 trillion derivatives market and created a new kind of mathematical object.,"White paper is in progress, but I will summarize the theory here.  I offer it to the internet for free, and only hope that you will use its power responsibly.  Also, I made an error in the topic title... the derivatives market isn't worth 1.4 trillion (ap, you twit).  It's $1.4 quadrillion.  
  
**What I propose is a new kind of asset, a 2-dimensional and n-dimensional bitcoin.  I am calling it a cryptocontract.**  
  
As I listened to speculation about the price of bitcoin on stage at the Dubai Conference, it occurred to me what the next step should be.  
  
Bitcoin binary options recently became a thing (http://btcoracle.com/) but it's not enough.  It's all still centralized.  All trading is.  
  
All trading and asset speculation is conducted through the SEC and other central regulatory agencies.  There's no way to either hedge your risk on a given asset, OR to speculate on a particular asset's price in the future without going through a centrally regulated agency.  
  
**Say hello to crypto-options.**  
  
It's been a while since I've been in computer science (like ten years) so I don't know exactly how this would work, but I do know how it would function.  What you would need is a crypto asset with a public hash that has TWO solutions (or more, but lets start simple).  That way, when that crypto asset is generated (let's call it a cryptocontract for future brevity) it has a hard condition coded into it that will resolve at some point in the future, based on the price of a given asset.  
  
For example, let $condition = ""the price of bitcoin is greater than $1000 on June 1st, 2015"".  
  
Now I know this is problematic on several fronts.  First of all you have to encode date sequencing into the condition, but that could be taken care of via block numbers.  Second, you need to agree on a metric of measure for the value, which I'm not sure how you would hard code into the contract.  
  
**The ultimate goal, of course, is to allow two people to make a bet which neither can back out of.**  
  
------------------------------  
  
Now that the cryptocontract is generated, the public hash that represents it (or is it, again I'm not an expert on this stuff) needs to have TWO solutions or keys.  That way owner 1, who is betting that $condition will be false owns it, and owner 2, who is betting that $condition will be true also owns it.  
  
As the specified block (or date) on the condition approaches, the contract naturally resolves to either true or false.  In other words, just like a real options contract, it becomes either more or less likely to happen.  
  
See where I'm going with this?  **Just like a real options contract, it's not just about the cryptoasset and it's eventual resolution.  The contract itself THEN also has a value and can be traded, sold, and bought.**  
  
Right now if you want to do this, whether it's to wildly gamble or hedge your risk, you have to go through a central agency.  But with my cryptocontract you don't have to.  It's decentralized by design, anonymous so you don't even have to know or trust the person that you are creating the contract with, and resolves automatically so that no one can back out of the bet once made.  
  
Even better, if you later decide that you like the value of your current side of the contract at this moment and don't want to see it through to resolution, you can simply sell it on the open market.  
  
**Here's an important part:**  Once the asset hits its expiration block, it AUTOMATICALLY resolves so that at *that* moment, only one of the private keys becomes valid and the other invalid, based on whether $condition is true.  
    
Once you can create a hash with two private solutions, it should be trivial to create one with multiple solutions, or even one with multiple conditions.  
  
Basically, you can then create a ladder of conditions with multiple owners all owning a slice of that cryptocontract.  As the contract nears resolution and only one of those eventualities becomes true, one owner emerges and resolves at the specified time.  
  
Holy shit, this could even be used for elections and all sorts of other applications.  Imagine an election with perfect transparency, with all voters assigned a way to 'bid' on the outcome of the cryptocontract, with each candidate owning a slice of that contract.  When the contract resolves at 'final' election day, one candidate emerges.  
  
I just decentralized the 1.4 trillion derivatives market **and** solved the transparency problem with democracy, and it's not even noon yet.  If one of you other geniuses makes this real, hit me up on Changetip.  Consider this my first white paper, bitch.  
  
2-dimensional and n-dimensional cryptocoins are a real, mathematical construct.  Because they can exist, they will eventually exist.  And they will be worth trillions of dollars.  The only question is who will create and popularize them first?
  
americanpegasus just changed the world.   Again.   
  
---------------------------  
  
**edit #1 - 0902z - 14/12/14**: I'm just realizing how such an asset would have initial value, and I'm thinking about how it would function.  Would it be a side chain, or built upon the bitcoin block chain?  It would have to be.  Because in order for it to exist, value has to be input into it.  
  
For example, if I offer you such a contract, you have to buy it from me.  The only way to make this happen is in bitcoins.  So how would this work?  Ok, let's let the cryptocontract be represented by the symbol **&**, and this particular contract, ""The price of bitcoins will be greater than $1000 on June 1st, 2015"" be 'b'.  Also, let my stake in the contract be represented by **&b-1** (believing it will happen), and yours represented as **&b-0** (believing it will not happen).    
  
So I am offering **&b-1** for sale.  My price is approximately $350, or 1 bitcoin.  Even if that's not a fair price, let's just assume it is for ease of illustration.  I don't believe it will come true, and if you do, let's dance.    
  
You agree to purchase this asset, and so we have to create it on the network.  To do that we'll need to both pay into a system so that we both have something at stake.  I transfer a bitcoin into **&b**, and so do you.  
  
At this point we both own **&b**, as there are two private keys.  By design, no value can be extracted from **&b** until the target block (resolution date) has passed.  This prevents anyone from backing out of the bet.  And at the target block (which it timed to occur around June 1st, 2015) one of our private keys is destroyed, and only the other remains, effectively granting us access to the 2 bitcoins stored within.  Of course, throughout the contract process, the value of each of our keys fluctuates too.  If it looks increasingly likely that condition will be true, the value of **&b-1** approaches the limit of 2, while **&b-0** approaches zero (worthless).  
  
But this method only allows the issuance of straight bets.  It works as long as all the functions work, but there's a better way, and also the problem of external values still needs to be solved.  
  
I have a long drive home.  I'll keep thinking about this.  Ideas are welcome.  I don't own math; we all do, I just want to help create it.  
  
-----------------------  
  
**edit #2 - 0936z - 14/12/14**:  Shit, what if value didn't NEED to be extracted?  What if bitcoins were destroyed in the process of creating this cryptocontract (**&**)?  Then the contract would by default have the value of 2 bitcoins because that's how much currency was destroyed in the creation of it.  
  
Then no 'extraction of value' is necessary.  The asset (almost like a collectible trading card, but one created by literally burning money) only exists because two people agreed to destroy money to create it.  And eventually, only one of them will own it.  
  
The value of 2 bitcoins in this object is inherent, as long as the faith of the cryptocontract system remains.  
  
**edit 3**:  I figured it out.   I solved the centralization issue.   It obviously can't be based on a USD exchange set value.  It either has to be one of two things.  Either a fluctuating value determined by people's faith  in buying what the contract represents.... or A globally observable and verifiable metric like total hash rate!

We've hosted [senators](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bwpqqi/we_are_us_senator_ron_wyden_and_reddit_ceo_steve/), [governors](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c66qxi/im_john_hickenlooper_a_geologist_turned_brewer/), [cartoonists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/atlfb8/im_a_political_cartoonist_turned_political/), [leftists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8ux46x/we_are_organizers_from_the_occupyicepdx_movement/) and [rightists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5rvt51/im_roger_stone_political_insider_and_longtime/?ref=search_posts), [lawyers](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c8ciwp/im_amy_howe_supreme_court_reporter_for_howe_on/), [mayors](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6dbfr3/hello_im_mike_rawlings_mayor_of_dallas_home_of/?sort=qa), some [communists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6evqkk/our_names_are_chauncey_robinson_joe_sims_and/?utm_term=53d9c821-efe5-4947-8793-cf0d29357e91&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=politics&utm_content=1), some [anti-communists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/66caxl/ama_with_ben_shapiro_the_daily_wires_ben_shapiro/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit), and a whole lot more. We have built wonderful lasting relationships with organizations such as [Advance Local](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8a21wu/im_connor_sheets_the_alcom_reporter_whos_been/?sort=qa), [the ACLU](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bmmiix/were_aclu_voting_rights_and_mass_incarceration/), and [The Washington Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6di3em/im_david_fahrenthold_washington_post_reporter_who/).

We have come a really long way in these three years, and we're so proud of what we've built with all your help. The AMA program is a labor of love that takes a long time. I reach out to folks that I or other mods think of, or [you suggest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPb-2CtL2lIsMo9xOvs6sdQGDymyZ29seWyQsNTJy1oxPthw/viewform?usp=sf_link) (did you know I've contacted over 750 people and organizations about AMAs?), as well as have them reach out to us, or be referred to us by /u/Chtorrr and our other friends on the Reddit admin team. I send several emails every single day, and even make the occasional phone call to organize AMAs and educate their hosts. [Our calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=rpoliticsmods@gmail.com) is meticulously updated, the AMA list kept fresh, and flairs are handed out to every verified submitter. Lately we've begun using [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/rSlashPolitics) to keep you in the loop, because nobody should ever miss an AMA they're excited about.

&#x200B;

We want to take this post to celebrate, to thank all our wonderful guests for their time, to thank you, the participants for asking so many thoughtful questions, to reminisce about the times we've had, and to brainstorm together about where we'd like to go in the future.

&#x200B;

Let me know what your favorite AMA has been, and let me know who you'd like to see in the time to come. Let me know what you like as-is, and what you'd like to see tweaked.
