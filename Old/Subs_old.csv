crm4y3,Understanding Yield Curve Inversion,"Hello Fam, I'm noticing a lot of information and misinformation on yield curve inversion of US Treasury curve so I thought we should all do a quick exercise together to best understand how it all works.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",r/finance,1566048606.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/crm4y3/understanding_yield_curve_inversion/,takeitor_leaveit,319,0.96,38,,False,278566,1,False,0,324

clxwyi,Just Warning Everybody About CNN Money. Do Not Trust Them. They Post Explicitly Fake Analyst Forecasts,"Recently I came across an article purporting that CNN posts fake buy ratings, and at first I thought it was just some Trump touting conspiracy article, but I had to click and see because I am naturally inquisitive. I'll entertain any angle, and as a trader, money talks, so if somebody is posting fake buy ratings, that can be the difference between making a fortune, or losing everything in certain circumstances.

I read the article, and there is an archived link to an analyst consensus estimate for Alibaba. CNN has it listed at $1500, a 12 month 800% increase. Even when you see it, it's still hard to believe, but I checked their website and it's actually still there. They haven't taken it down, and the archived link was several months old. Has anybody else noticed this or is it just me? I'm pretty sure CNN is breaking several securities laws right now, and they also risk being sued...

cuuo6j,"Yooo get in here peeps, *State Of The Subreddit*, guidelines for political threads, and setting some aggressive penalties for violations - Discussion Thread. Speak now or forever hold your temp ban.","Alright guys, first I'm going to lay out my thoughts, feelings, and aim for the direction of this subreddit.  I've heard this echoed several times but I'll be blunt: the quality of discussion here has slipped over time, especially concerning anything that's remotely political.  My goal is to maintain a higher standard of investment discussion than your average financial subreddit (looking at you /r/personalfinance).  Obviously this is a general investing forum so we're open to all but I rarely see white papers posted anymore and I see a lot more stuff that isn't really that relevant to investing.  I personally have taken to removing these threads automatically - something like ""elon musk tweets that he wants to build an elevator to the moon by q12020 just isn't really investing news.  Sure it's interesting and funny, perhaps even newsworthy, but it's not something that really deserves to be on the front page of the subreddit.

So guidelines on corporate posts, /u/crasymike has guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I feel like these are very thorough and complete.  Feel free to weigh in here but I'm largely just reiterating what he said.  I think those are super good guidelines and I'm happy with the clarity it provides us in describing why we're removing threads that we don't think are investment related.  If anyone wants a real world example a lil bit back I removed a thread that was about BOA raising their minimum wage to $15/hr.  That's great news, it's definitely newsworthy somewhere, it's not relevant to investing.  Now if someone broke down staff costs for BOA and which percentage of those were low earning employees then in turn described how this would impact BOA's cashflow then perhaps it would have stayed.  But that wasn't the case.  Hopefully that provides some good clarity on what we're looking for here. 

So on to the big question mark.  We've been cracking down on this for months but I'd like to lay out some firm guidelines for political posts and comments.  Basically I'm going to mimic Mike's post above but also I want to discuss how we feel about aggressive enforcement.  First let me start by laying out my reasoning:

Anyone that's been slumming around this sub long enough remembers that it used to be a lot different when we were south of 400k subscribers.  Things change, that's fine.  But back then we had a higher percentage of industry professionals and more seasoned investors.  When politics came up most people weren't interested in the low effort mudslinging.  Most people here just stuck to discussing the investment aspect of something naturally, [here's a great example of a thread on Bernie's transaction tax in 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/40usw0/bernie_sanders_002_percent_financial_transactions/).  Now lets be honest, if that thread was posted today within 30 minutes the entire thread would be people arguing about socialism, student debt, boomers, Trump's haircut or skintone, really just about anything but the actual impact of transaction tax on markets.  And the rest would be ""why does bernie hate retirement funds"" or some other similarly low effort bullshit that displays absolutely no analysis.  That's bad.

Now, to be clear I believe we need harsher enforcement of comments in political threads than regular threads.  Lets be honest with ourselves, people personally identify with politicians and take personal offense to political attacks.  That's just the way it is.  Everyone is just so damn worked up and angry about politics.  If I say I think Jack Welch was a shitty CEO or that the management team over at Exxon is full of idiots I may have people disagree with me but it's not going to create a situation where some mob of Welch supporters starts calling me a fucking moron.  If I say Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders is an idiot then people are going to lose their shit.  So here's the thing: top and high level comments are key.  As much as I hate it people upvote these inflammatory comments, then people respond aggressively because they've been personally offended, then all of the sudden I can't actually discern /r/investing from the comments section of your local news station on facebook.  Seriously, if you ever want to feel like a genius go to the facebook comments on a local news article, any news article, really.  it's filled with complete idiocy.  That's what we're fighting, because if this is left unchecked all of the sudden this place looks like /r/politics or /r/the_donald and nobody wants that.  If you want those sort of posts then you can go there. 

So here's what I'm proposing, you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.

**Tied to investing:** This should be obvious but damn I can't tell you how many top level comments I remove concerning immigration, social rights, literally just people's disdain for [politician], how hard it is out there for millennials, etc.  you have to understand what your comment does, it attracts other comments that are discussing this subject and all of the sudden we've got a thread about manufacturing filled with comments discussing how it's hard to make a down payment on a house.  Look home ownership is nice but that's not topical and not related to investing. 

**Effort:** This is admittedly subjective but lets give some examples:

Bad: This is fucking stupid, why does bernie hate savers, MAGA!, Trade wars are easy to win right?, Orange man bad, lots of TDS here, Pocahontas just wants to tax your money away, Tulsi Gabbard's workout video on instagram is hot, [republicans/democrats/specific politican] hate america, etc.

Do these add to any sort of conversation in any manner?  No.

Good: ""Wow, I think Trump's recent move is pretty bad, China can do XYZ which will cause imports to go up/down and this is bad because ABC.""  or ""Trump is in the right here, with the current IP theft we need to take strong action, this will set us up for XYZ""  

these are both differing positions that people may agree/disagree with but you're making a good faith effort to have a discussion.  This is good. 

**Civility:**  I'm having a lot of people that don't post here a lot telling me that the current political climate warrants outrage and they need to be able to express that.  No you don't.  There's literally hundreds of politically oriented subreddits for you to go rant about how outraged you are.  You'll get plenty of upvotes and no crabby mods are going to ban you for shitting on their lawn.  True story.  I'm going to be completely honest: if people are not capable of discussing a topic that impacts investing without losing their shit and lobbing insults then they are not the sort of person we're catering to.  So lets quantify that too: 

Bad: this fucking idiot is going to ruin the country.  Bernie is a socialist and will ruin everything.  Trump is literally incompetent.  He's a criminal.  Republicans are literally just in it for their own self interest.  Democrats hate America.

Good: I definitely disagree with this approach, so far I'm not happy with this presidency because of [investment related XYZ].  I don't like [candidate] because of [investment related XYZ].  

I don't think it's too much to ask for everyone to not use this sub for their partisan word vomit.

**Now on to enforcement**

Here's my proposal, I haven't run this by anyone yet so I'm sure other mods will chime in and we'll all arrive at something together.  When I remove comments that don't fit in the conversation I check a lot of post histories.  95% of the time the people that come here to throw political haymakers never post here otherwise.  They often frequent political subs(yeah, news and worldnews count) and they are often the worst offenders with derailing conversation.  I kinda get it, maybe they subbed here but don't know anything about investing.  Investing can have a steep learning curve but everyone knows which politician they hate.  So, with the context that I intend to write up a long post of finalized posting/comment guidelines and combine that with the current corporate news vs investment news sticky, then have automod post a sticky to political threads imploring people read said guidelines BEFORE posting and that violating said guidelines results in an immediate ban I propose this:

If someone diverts conversation purposefully to political topics that aren't related, they post some low effort meme [MAGA, Orange man, TDS, any given trump insult, stable genius, trade wars are easy to win, Pocahontas, I'm sure I'm missing tons], or they just insult a politician overtly (think ""fucking idiot"" vs this isn't smart) then they're getting a 30 day ban.  

If they attack a person directly for their position, their post is a prolonged rant/personal attack against a politician/party, or they're being extreme about violating the above guidelines then they get a 60 day or possibly permanent ban depending on severity.  To be clear there have been some subjects that automatically get people permabans already.  Racism, homophobia, religious attacks(dude I swear someone asked about Sharia compliant investments and got insulted three times before someone answered), death threats, etc have warranted permabans already. 

My reasoning is simple: in my observation most of the toxic behavior comes from people who aren't contributing otherwise.  I don't really want them as subscribers.  I personally am fine with hurting our subscriber numbers if it means better more focused discussion.  

So thoughts?  have at it.

Other things I wanted to float that are tangentially related:  Possibly instituting character minimums for posts?  Either self posts or comments as well.  We might grant exceptions to regular contributors?  I really have absolutely no idea how or even if I could pull that off.  And I certainly don't know if it's a good idea.

cwed0y,WeWork Is the Most Ridiculous IPO of 2019,"Pretty good article that sums up all of the problems related to WeWork (IPO expected in September). Here's my tl;dr (although don't quote me one it):

* Uses an 8.2% discount rate on it's long-term lease obligations while IWG (it's closest competitor) uses a 3.7% discount rate. Huge red flag as it effectively understates the liabilities (we're talking billions of dollars).
* IPO underwriting group (JPM, UBS & CS) alose extended massive personal lines of credit to Neumann. Creates an interesting conflict of interest because if the stock does poorly at the IPO and  then there is a margin call, the banks would be forced to sell Neumann's pledged shares.
* Re-iterating the corporate governance mess (dual-class shares, self-dealing, family involved, etc.).
* Still trades at 15x the valuation of IWG for no apparent reason.

cw6la2,"My trading strategy..,this is what works for me.","About me:

A (former) long-time investment adviser who is a very active trader. I've also worked in private equity for several years.

I'm here to share my strategy on trading and significantly increasing overall income.

I have ""rules"" that I trade by. They work for me. They're guidelines. They may or may not be for you.

I will share my trades and results. I will not discuss or offer opinions on the fundamentals of a company. I'm happy to comment (if asked) as to what trade I would enter on a company. I am not licensed to give advice.

What I do is rather simple - yet most advisers/investors know nothing about it. 

It's called covered-call writing. I'm sure many here have heard of it or used this strategy. There are various ways to implement using covered calls - I keep it as simple as possible.

Essentially - you are buying a stock, then selling the right to have the shares taken away from you at a particular price, on a specific date. For selling that right - you receive a premium (income).

My personal trading rules:

1 - Invest in companies you know, and want to be invested in. Quality companies.

2 -  Diversify industries. Banks/steel/transportation/tech/pharma etc.

3 - Hedge. I keep at least one precious metal company in my portfolio at all times.

4 - Keep your emotions in check. The market is fluid. You will be right. You will be wrong. Don't chase a stock in any direction.

5 - Use income to average down. If you are invested in several companies, not all will move in tandem. Take some of the income you've generated to average down.

6 - Sell the call option right after the purchase of shares or previous option expiry.

7 - If you use margin - only use half of what you're allowed to. Use none if you don't understand the risks.

8 - Stay short-term. The call options I sell are typically 2 to 4 weeks out. I can always by back shares if they're taken away.

9 - Be patient. Don't stare at your screen all day (unless this IS your career).

10 - Try to have an option(s) expiring every week. Generate income weekly.

I will put up a couple examples as well.",r/investing,1566922297.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cw6la2/my_trading_strategythis_is_what_works_for_me/,totalreturntrading,95,0.84,69,,False,788310,0,False,0,96

cw2b1d,Are there any tools/sites to compare the holdings of two ETFs? I'd like to see the overlap (or not) to prevent over diversification.,"Take for instance LGLV, SPLV, and USMV.

I can also see what percentage of their holdings are in different sectors (e.g., SPLV is heavier into utilities and real estate). And I can browse their top 10-15 holdings and try to eyeball it on that basis.

But beyond that, trying to compare all holdings--from over 100, to over 200 in the case of these ETFs--could get tedious. And given a choice from these three, it would also be nice to compare that to some other ETFs I have.

A tool to aid that kind of comparison would help. Does it exist?

Buy AMD @ $29.85 (current price as I type). SELL the September 13th, $30.50 strike covered-calls at $1.05/contract.

The math - upside potential $30.50 - $29.85 = $0.65 

PLUS option income of $1.05 = $1.70 potential total return in just over 2 weeks. That's a 5.5% potential total return.

Risks - you still own a stock. The market moves. There's also opportunistic risk - shares of AMD could be worth more than the $30.50 strike price on Sept. 13th and you are forced to sell them @ $30.50.

cvrgip,"Do you believe in the concept of ""just paper losses"" in your stock market portfolio?","My parents lost lots of money during the 2000-2002 and 2007-2009 stock market crashes.  But for a long period of time most of their losses were ""just paper losses.""  A least that is what their friends and family told them to make them feel better.  They had some of their portfolios in bond funds but they were the majority stocks. (Maybe too much in stocks for their age.)

As the news reported day after day after day of stock market losses during these terrible bear markets, they started to panic.  They tried to tell themselves these were not real losses but just paper loses but panic started to overwhelm them.  They could not sleep and when they did they had terrible nightmares of losing everything.

My folks had a tough life with lots of awful jobs and it was a real struggle to save and invest their money.  As the stock market continued to crash, they kept thinking about the toils and tedium they went through to earn the money they had invested that was now disappearing daily.

By early 2009, the paper loses became just too real and they sold many of their retirement assets taking a huge tax hit.  They moved to cash with the surviving funds and are still struggling financially due to their fears.

Move ahead to 2020, when the next stock market crash how can I stop believing that my losses are not just paper losses when they seem so real?  I am afraid I will sell my investments!

cw5bdb,The sectors - an introduction,"Hej everyone,

&#x200B;

over the last couple of days and weeks I have dug myself into the world wide web to learn about investing. Far too late, at least in my opinion, I discovered this topic for me and have spent most of my time scavenging the web for information and compiling one Google Spreadsheet after another containing said information. Now, all the information that I have come across has helped me to understand something and those spreadsheets with all that information is what I want to share to those who are on the same path as I am. Maybe some of the more experianced investors in the sub also take a look just out of curiosity and maybe some of those will leave some input which I would find fantastic!

&#x200B;

So the first thing I had to learn about were the different sectors and this is what this post is about. It is nothing groundbreaking and no rocket sience, but I have learned something out of this too. I understood the concept of diversification as a way to split the risks of loosing across different sectors since it is very unlikely that all will crash at once. That this concept carries a lot further than that is comething that I just then realised. Here is what I have learned:

&#x200B;

\- You split your investments across different sectors to split the risk of a sector failing and ""loosing"" your investment

\- Different sectors carry different risks with them

\- The risk within a sector can originate from different sources: Consumer Discretionaries: Economic cycle, Energy: Political Events, Utilities: Interest rate and so on

\- You can not only offset the risk of loosing you investment by diversification, but you can also offset the risk with a (in comparison) saver investment (Consumer staple : Consumer Discretionaries)

\- Offsetting the risk reduces the fluctuations within an investment portfolio and smoothens the highs and lows

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I went through the articles regarding the different sectors on investopedia and noted everything down for myself for later reference. This is what the Google Sheet is all about. I combined different sectors into one sheet since this is how I am treating them within my portfolio since I regard them as one or they are so similar that it makes sense in my mind. As an example:

\- Consumer Goods: Consumer staples + Consumer Discretionaries 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some combinations might not be understandable at first, like: 

Energy: Energy + Utilities

Utilities also includes partially areas that I would count towards energy. The problem is that energy is considered a basic utility that it is taken out of the energy sector and added to the utility. I am only including the energy part of utilities into the energy sector. The remainder I count towards the industrial sector. 

&#x200B;

Besides listing the key points of the respective article (link is also provided), I also listed a couple of companies to just give an idea (not as recommondations!). If you have any questions feel free to ask, if you have any comment, feel free as well.

cvr03w,Questions about GME,"I've been following GME lately, which has been trending down for quite awhile as revenue has been slowly but steadily declining as more consumers are turning to digital rather than in-store sales.  In recent history the company has been unable to find a buyer, has eliminated dividend payments to shareholders, and has very recently had two rounds of layoffs.  The company initiated and exercised a portion of a buyback earlier this year, after which the price of their stock fell further still.  The one possible positive the company has going for it is availability of cash, which Michael Burry recently urged the BoD to use in exercising the remainder of their buyback program:  [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-spikes-big-short-michael-burry-goes-long-2019-8-1028467346](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-spikes-big-short-michael-burry-goes-long-2019-8-1028467346) 

&#x200B;

Q3 earnings is expected within the next month or so, and consensus is that the company will post negative EPS, yet the stock price has soared in the \~ week since Burry announced that he's long on Gamestop.

&#x200B;

So I guess my question is in regards to the stock's recent rise in price.  Is this hopeful investors counting on the buyback of shares?  If so, should another significant price decrease be expected following the buyback, given all the other negatives going for it?  I guess I'm confused at the market activity right now; I've got a short position on GME because this looks and acts to me like a company without a definite future, and yet more and more people seem to be buying into Dr. Burry's message of going long on Gamestop, and I don't understand why.

cvooz2,Long Thesis: SS&C Technologies," Investment Thesis:

We like the stock because of its cloud-related initiatives which are transitioning the company to a purer SaaS business model, thus driving margin expansion in the near future. According to the market research [report](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-financial-services-application-market-industry) created by Mordor Intelligence, the Software & Services market of the financial industry is expected to reach CAGR of 7-8% over the next 5 years. SSNC has been taking advantage of positive industry dynamics in the past, by generating inorganic revenue CAGR of 30% with a 95% retention rate, EPS CAGR of over 20%, combined with a very strong margin expansion since its IPO back in 2010.

The company has a strong competitive advantage by offering a broad suite of products that simplify and unify tasks from several departments across the entire financial institution. Particular products help the asset management firms to make better strategic decisions when it comes down to generating excess return rather than spending time on unnecessary trade execution or regulatory tasks. Even though the company has recently cut its Q3&Q4 and full-year FY19 guidance, we still believe that the company can execute on new large deals. In our opinion, it will result from its long-term partnerships and strong customer relationships, thus making strong cross-sell opportunities or even receiving a higher number of outsourced services from the existing client base.

I might even be taxed on dividends as they accumulate in the account and gains from the result of sales within the fund, but that’s something I’ll have to confirm. The same would apply to traditional accounts. It’s like being treated the same as a standard brokerage account yet it has tons of restrictions on being able to withdraw from the US side. This renders the benefits of the retirement accounts worthless. 

I’ve been maxing Roth IRA (in addition to employer traditional 401k), but I’m starting to think it’s pointless especially given the I’m in a high-tax state which I definitely will not retire in. I’d either retire in a LCOL/low tax state or more likely another country (my partner is not a US citizen).",r/investing,1566823741.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cvnmu8/should_i_avoid_retirement_accounts_if_i_will_move/,PutridParsley,4,0.71,14,,False,788310,0,False,0,6

cvawj0,Why do people from China like investing in residential real estate?,"The city I live in is flooded with money coming from China and the prices of residential real estate is sky high. I was talking with my neighbor who is from China, she said she owns 8 different apartments that has no one living in them and are just empty, because she believes that prices will ALWAYS go up.

I asked her, how she can be sure that prices for apartments will never go down, she told me to not worry too much as everyone is buying apartments because it is a good way to make money.

But I doubt prices WILL ALWAYS go up like she said, all bubbles come to an end. Literally in my building, only 30% of the units have people living in them. The rest are completely empty, and the owners are all living in China. They don't rent them out either, just sits empty. If interest rates goes up or the banks stop lending, then there will be so many apartment on the market, the bubble will burst very quickly. Whatever the appreciation in value is only on paper unless you can convert into real returns.

It seems like such a waste of Capital, alot of that investment could be going into businesses or more productive parts of the economy. Instead they just put them into steel and concrete.

Can someone explain to me why Chinese people think this way? Are there cultural reasons to this? Is this just a case of: ""everybody does it, so I will to""? I don't see many white folks or other people lining up around the block to purchase apartments from the sales office when a new building is planned.

BIARRITZ, France — President Trump asserted on Saturday that he has the authority to make good on his threat to force all American businesses to leave China, citing a national security law that has been used mainly to target terrorists, drug traffickers and pariah states like Iran, Syria and North Korea.

“It’s difficult to move out of China, and any time they are forced to do so by tariffs, this is a momentous act,” said Ker Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. ”We are in no position to give up the China market — it’s too large, it’s too important.”

Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a president can declare a “national emergency” in case of “any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States” from abroad. This triggers special authority for the president to regulate “any transactions in foreign exchange” by Americans.",r/investing,1566697999.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cv2c0c/trump_asserts_he_can_force_us_companies_to_leave/,coolcomfort123,879,0.93,270,,False,788310,1,False,0,873

cvfxdt,Due Diligence Literature,"Honorary first post; I usually lurk so I don’t say stupid things (which I reserve for wsb, of course). This is going to be a stupid thing, because I’d like to be less stupid in my approach to investing. I’m here because WSB would tear me apart. Bear with me if you can.

I’m looking for some decent literature on carrying out due diligence. I’m becoming less interested in restricting 100% of my investments into trading on companies that everybody knows has great long term value. I work in the IT world, and I see a lot of these publicly traded cloud companies that people are discussing, and have the opportunity of carrying out due diligence on them as investments while I evaluate and learn about their products. 

However, this poses a few questions. How does determining value of a company change from various sectors? What kind of scandal could be extremely negative for tech that would hardly impact retail outlets? Data breaches certainly affect cloud providers far more than credit companies, as we’ve recently realized. I understand there is no simple set out answer, but who are some good authors, articles, or podcasts (any medium is fine for me) that typically discuss this information.

Now, I hate to ask this to begin with, as Google definitely exists. However, investing is so trendy nowadays; a lot of articles seem to be pretty skin deep and flood my search results. I would go with obvious books like The Intelligent Investor, but I’m not sure how the relevancy of Ben Graham has carried on after four decades of the guy being dead. I’ve heard the foundational knowledge is great, but not always applicable to current markets. Are there better, more relevant pieces written in respect to the modern market?

If you can’t recall any literature, what are the right questions to be asking in searching for methods of due diligence? 

Finally, I’m sorry this isn’t as concise as I’d like it to be.

cvelx1,Do REITS buy properties on leverage?,"Hi, 

If you invest in REITS do you still get the possible appreciation advantage of buying a property with leverage? 

One of the arguments I read about from proponents of real estate investing is that you can take advantage of leverage by using a mortgage. So if you put 20% down on a 300k home and it appreciates by 10% in the first year you would have a 50% return in one year (If you sold or refinanced hypothetically). 

But if REITS also buy on leverage, wouldn't you have the same advantage? In other words, if a REIT buys a property finances 80% of it, and 20 years later it sells it for a higher price, don't you, as a shareholder, get the appreciation from the property via a capital gains distribution? 

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks",r/investing,1566768920.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cvelx1/do_reits_buy_properties_on_leverage/,Matt1251255,14,0.9,22,,False,788310,0,False,0,15

about the difficulty about moving portfolio allocations in taxable accounts. I have plenty of stocks in my portfolio that I have held for close to or over 10 years. In my country there are also laws that if an investment has been held for more than 10 years its purchase price for tax purposes is calculated to be either original or 50% of current value (which ever is higher), which means that the on paper tax burden is reducing with time. In the current market situation I would like to reduce my portfolio risks, but selling anything will result in very large tax effects and as is demonstrated in the article, that will in the end cause tax friction that will be money lost in the long term. **What strategies are others using in these situations?** I have a very basic strategy of keeping ""new money"" on the sidelines (mostly on short term bonds, which as an investment is pretty bad besides the low risk) when I see risks increasing and investing that into stock market when situation gets worse. In the current situation I have also been thinking of adding around 2 year hedge on the portfolio through either options/warrants/bear fund. That is pretty expensive often, but adding that for even 20-30% portfolio value would mean that when I want to get fully invested again I would have a lot of dry powder and I would not create the tax friction on my current investments.",r/investing,1566804851.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cvktfe/reducing_risk_in_portfolio_and_its_tax_effects/,InnocentiusLacrimosa,2,1.0,0,,False,788310,0,False,0,2

cus4fr,Why tariffs terrify the markets: The Legacy of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act,"History does not repeat. But it does rhyme.

> The Legacy of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act

> The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was a grave error for U.S. trade policy. As the United States slid into depression, the act represented a desperation move by Congress and President Hoover. Since then, presidents have regarded free trade as the rule rather than the exception. Economist Douglas A. irwin discusses the Smoot-Hawley Act and its legacy.

cv36nq,Where will US stock markets go this week (Aug 26 to 30)?," This past Monday Aug 19, I posted:

""The DJIA went up about 250 points today (Aug 19) because:

\- 10 year T-bill yields were up Sunday night and into Monday, reducing talk of recession;

\- stimulus announced by China on Saturday (Aug 17) and potential German stimulus discussed on Monday (Aug 19);

\- US Commerce department's extension for Huawei.

So what does this mean for the remainder of the week?

**Tuesday to Thursday (Aug 20 to 22):** If the yield curve does not invert again, expect that US stock markets will either move sideways or increase slightly (S&P may increase to 2950 level). If yield curve does invert again, expect a major drop in stock markets (S&P down again to 2825 level).

**Friday (Aug 23)**: If Jerome Powell doesn't give investors what they want to hear, expect the markets to drop, maybe as much as 500 points. And if Jerome Powell does give investors what they want to hear, the market will go up.""

\------------------------------------------

So this leads us to the million dollar question: where will US stock markets head next week (Aug 26 to 30)?

Was the August carnage in the stock markets a market bottom and will the markets now turn and head back up? Will we see a major bounce-back rally next week from Friday's big drop (S&P down to 2847)?

Or was Friday's drop (caused by Trump's tweet ordering US companies out of China) the beginning of a downward slide?

cv38ly,Would Berkshire hathaway be a good hedge against a downturn?,"Hi,

I am a beginner and just learning fundamentals of investing. However, I had a question , do you think BRK.B would be a great hedge against a downturn? My reasoning is because Berkshire's cash position (100B+ from my understanding) would allow opportunities to deploy this capital in a downturn. The stock is great as a long term investment from my understanding, one of their largest downsides is having their large cash position as a drag on yield.

I have not read this idea anywhere after searching, so I would like to get the opinion of you guys. I know Buffet/Munger have a history of investing in sort of low risk / companies with great balance sheets and with predictable returns (no ""fancy"" stocks). My reasoning is that in a downturn they would be able to deploy capital and pick of value companies for pennies on the dollar, similar to what they did in '08. What are your thoughts?

Thanks

Edit: (I almost entirely do indexes for investing purposes, I am just curious on your thoughts on Berkshire - even though it is sort of like a mutual fund from a diversity perspective).

BIARRITZ, France (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that he had second thoughts about escalating the trade war with China, but the White House later reversed that message saying the president was misinterpreted and that his only regret in hiking tariffs is that he didn't raise them higher.

Trump faced a tense reception from world leaders meeting amid mounting anxiety of a global economic slowdown at the Group of Seven summit in France. During a breakfast meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Trump suggested he had qualms about the spiraling conflict. ""Yeah. For sure,"" Trump told reporters when asked if he has second thoughts about escalating the dispute, adding he has ""second thoughts about everything.""

But hours later, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement saying Trump's comments about U.S. tariffs on China were ""greatly misinterpreted.""

Ricchiuto wrote the following: “The key to breaking out of this deflationary downward spiral of interest rates is to target inflation by expanding the Fed’s balance sheet — in other words, print money. This bold action will keep the domestic economy from being pulled down the hole in which both Europe and Japan find themselves — that of negative, long-term interest rates.”

cv2wnj,Why Uber and Lyft Won't Exist in 10 Year...," This is 100% my own belief and I might get a lot of hate for it but I don't think Uber and Lyft will exist as they are now in the future. It could be that I've invested in both of these companies in the last 2 weeks and lost almost 18% so far but I'm started to believe these two innovative companies will be nonexistent in 10 years time. They are still great short term investments as they aren't completely useless (valued about $100 billion combined for a reason).

Why? They are not making little to no money right now and just gaining brand popularity and are betting on making money once they can roll out self-driving cars. Uber more than Lyft which is why Uber is losing a lot more money on research than Lyft. Once self-driving cars do roll out, I think a lot more people would use Waymo by Google and its all because of Google Maps. Everyone uses Google Maps, there is no good alternative. Even Uber uses Google Maps. When people search where they want to go, Google can easily advertise their Waymo self-driving cars that can make them tons of money. Noone is competing with Uber or Lyft right now because it's not worth it. These companies are not making much money. Self-driving cars are what Uber and Lyft are both relying on. Uber is making their own self-driving technology but Lyft will probably license something from Tesla or Google. Google, however, have a huge advantage with Google Maps and having Android cover 85% of smartphone users. They can have Waymo pre-installed in the app and integrated with Google Maps.

Same goes with food (like UBER-EATS) and groceries. My bet is Google will dominate these two industries with their Android-users and Google Search. The only other competitors I can see is Amazon (using its Amazon-prime members) and Apple (using its iOS-users). Also, anyone can just ask Google Assistant for a taxi and it can call up a Waymo.",r/investing,1566700287.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cv2wnj/why_uber_and_lyft_wont_exist_in_10_year/,mrjammy,0,0.44,32,,False,788310,0,False,0,0

cuqccj,Eurodollar futures for the retail investor?,"I've heard a lot about buying eurodollar futures with high leverage as a bet on US interest rates continuing to fall.

Apart from the obvious risks on a gamble like this (and need for stop losses), I'm hoping someone can help me with the basic maths to figure out what kind of leverage you'd need to make, for example, double your money...

**1 contract** is priced at **$1,000,000**, so if I invest **$10,000** at **100:1** leverage, I get **1 contract**.  Now let's assume I buy at 98.8 (i.e. LIBOR at 1.2), and in 6 months eurodollar futures move to 100 (e.g. LIBOR at 0).  I make only **$3,000** according to ""Eurodollar (GE) - Globex"" on [https://www.danielstrading.com/trading-resources/futures-calculator](https://www.danielstrading.com/trading-resources/futures-calculator)

I'd need to buy 3.3 contracts to make **$10,000 (2x)** profit - meaning 300:1 leverage.  

Can I really have got that right?  I watched an interview with a professional investor hoping to make 5-10x returns with eurodollar futures, but I'm having a hard time believing anyone could get 2000:1 leverage?

cubn5v,Serious: What does a quant trader/statistician/mathematician exactly do while trading?,"(Posted earlier on [r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/))

Hey Traders!

The question pretty much sums it all. I am a semi-professional futures trader (CL, ZT, ZS, some crypto), who uses basic technical indicators since two years and has been fairly profitable.

That said, I don't understand the rush towards all things maths and statistics as a basic requirement to trade - if hedge fund and prop trading positions are considered.

So here's my humble question - where exactly does complex math, statistical model making, and computer programming come into the picture? Software dev positions are explanatory, but where do the aforementioned help? Doesn't the first rule of markets say you can't predict prices and movements?

Or is everyone rushing towards complex solutions which could have been solved fairly easily?

Worse still - are talks of ML, RL, AI, algo, etc a ""gimmick"" to attract investor capital?

All thoughts would be very, very helpful.

PS - Don't make this a discussion about TA vs Quant. I do use indicators to trade, but definitely, don't draw discretionary trend lines or watch ""heads and shoulders"" or analyze moon phases to place trades. In fact, I do think TA is complete bull, but using indicators has its logical reasons.

**Edit 1** \- Terrific answers, y'all. I am sure many others would be pleased over these insights.

**Edit 2** \- Here's an outline about how I trade. Mentioned it in one of the comments below but I guess it makes a good add-on to the passage:

As an economics graduate, I understand the most widely used macro-economic models and can construct most models used by mutual funds or I-banks. However, the use of ""complex"" math and Ph.D. degrees as a prerequisite to trade profitably goes right above me.

For example - while trading the soybean oil futures (ZL) market, I look at any directly affecting news variables or major import/export law changes or drastic macro climate changes that would impact ZL prices. I then form a hypothesis of which side (long/short) to take *more* exposure in, check basic moving averages, check soybean futures (they kinda *lead oil* prices indicator-wise) and depending on my screen availability, either trade aggressively or place a couple of contracts and walk away. Each contract costs me $490, each hundredth of a tick movement is worth $6, so a brief move nets me $300-$500 if I trade 6-7 contracts. Some days the market goes crazy and it equates to over a thousand dollars in profits, and it almost never does crazy reversals that I end up taking on a huge loss. For futures like NQ that are absolute beasts in terms of volatility and movement, a few contracts can easily net a few grand if the market goes ballistic (trump tweets, trade war updates, etc).

I guess my point is, this basic idea of how I trade gives me respectable profits - leaving me pondering for the need for a math or physics Ph.D. to trade markets profitably. However, generally knowing what they do greatly helps me appreciate the quant trading sector, and leaves a good impression of how I must not get comfortable with my strategy and look towards including more advanced concepts to ensure I don't end up crying my way to the morgue.",r/investing,1566553611.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cubn5v/serious_what_does_a_quant/,grittygatorr,154,0.92,86,,False,788310,0,False,0,157

I can understand that if you just buy a total market ETF this isn’t a problem, but wanted some info on what happens with ETFS as companies move up through indexes 

 Take for example A fictional company that is experiencing meteoric success and growth. It starts in the small cap index, but over the next decade sky rockets into mid cap and eventually S&P500.

If you buy into a small cap ETF, you’d share in the companies meteoric growth while its in the small cap index just like you would if you were an individual shareholder. But what happens as it migrated out of the small cap index due to its success?

I can understand how when a large company like say GE fails and collapses out of a large cap S&P500 that the ETF holders are protected as over time the ETF sells down shares in the failing company. But what happens in the inverse where the ETF buys more and more shares in a succeeding company that then leaves the index?

I understand generally that the individual success of a single company won’t weight the small cap index that much (600 companies in S&P600 and biggest holdings at moment are ~0.6%), but would the small cap ETF experience a downturn when a successful company or two migrate up? 

Or is it diversified enough that as the few successful companies move upwards, there’s no real effect on the ETF price?

There are usually many clones of fruit and vegetables which are continually introduced but there has been almost no research into bananas until very recently. The Cavendish is in danger of being wiped out.

Before the Cavendish, the most dominant banana variety was the Gros Michel, but this was wiped out in the 1950s by Panama Disease.

Researchers are currently working hard to produce a new resistant variety of banana which could replace the Cavendish.

cuhfrl,Quick clarification on the price of mutual funds as it relates to order timing.,"So, I'm aware that mutual fund prices are set once per day (typically near or after the end of day trading bell). What I'm a little confused about is how a price is associated with any given order.

Let's say that I initiate a $1000 order for $VTSAX at 1 pm, before the bell closes. The price of $VTSAX at the end of the day is $100, and my order is filled, meaning I receive 10 shares of $VTSAX upon execution and see that the next time my account is updated after all transactions are settled. Nothing fancy, and easy to understand.

Now let's say that I place an order for $VTSAX at 10 pm, after the price has been set at $100. Will I immediately have my order executed and receive 10 shares? Or, because the market has already closed, will my order be queued up and executed the next time that $VTSAX's price gets set, aka the end of the next trading day? Let's say that in this scenario, I initiate the same $1000 order at 10 pm, the closing price for the current day is $100, and the closing price for the next day is $200: **how many shares will I have when my $1000 order executes?**

cu77rb,Cosmetics Industry as a Hedge Against a Possible Recession?,"So I read a WSJ article not too long ago about how well the cosmetics industry is generally doing, despite the trade war. Sales have been especially strong in China and the Middle East where there's an ever-expanding middle-class, though in the case of a company like Estee Lauder with well-established brands like Clinique and M.A.C., sales are steady in the US as well.

 According to the article: ""Cosmetic companies aren't completely immune to tariff threats, but people are more willing to spend money on personal-care products in times of economic uncertainty, and they're typically one of the last things that people will cut back on,"" said Brian Yacktman, president and chief investment officer at YCG Investments, which has roughly $750 million in assets under management.

The cosmetic industry seems to have a good economic moat in the sense that people don't want to cut back on skin-care (inelastic demand), and are often stuck in a certain skin-care regimen resulting in plenty of repeat purchases. They have brand power and unlike some other retailers, can charge a premium price-point for their products.

cui54r,Cash-Asset Swap,"I'm an investing beginner and not sure how this ""Cash-Asset Swap"" work. Do you need to have some assets in an accessible account in order to swap? If it's so, why don't you just sell these assets you have in an accessible account anyway?

If you don't have any assets in an accessible account, how do you make sales order out of nothing?

Cash-Asset Swap

Sometimes you run into a situation where there’s cash in an account, but you can’t access it immediately. For example, you might have a locked-in account, like a pension or a LIRA (Locked-in Retirement Account), that you can’t access until a certain age.

You have some cash in some inaccessible account like a traditional IRA or a LIRA. What do you do? You perform a cash-asset swap. Here’s how it works. First, pick an ETF that exists in both accounts. For illustrative purposes, I’m going to make up an ETF called STK that’s priced at $ 10 a share.

Then you calculate how many units of this ETF will equal the amount of cash you want to get out from your inaccessible account. In this case, we want to move $ 5,000, so this would be $ 5000 / $ 10 = 500 shares. Log in to your brokerage account and place two orders: a sell order for five hundred shares in the accessible account and a buy order for the same five hundred shares in the inaccessible account. If your brokerage allows it, specify the exact price of $ 10 you’d like this order to be filled at.

If the orders go out at the same time, what should happen is that the stock market will match up your buy and sell orders with each other. Essentially, you’ll be “buying” this ETF from yourself.

You now have access to the cash you wanted, and because you bought and sold the same amount of shares, you haven’t changed your overall portfolio’s allocation. You’ve essentially accessed your locked-in cash using the stock market as the middleman.

While it’s easiest if you can do this with the same ETF, you can still do it with two different ETFs; you just need to calculate the right amount of each ETF based on its respective price.",r/investing,1566586259.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cui54r/cashasset_swap/,nobides,1,0.67,3,,False,788311,0,False,0,1

&#x200B;

I recently got into investing and am currently evaluating different companies and if they are worth investing. Therefore I looked up payout ratio's but the more I look, the more I am getting confused. I thought these numbers are based on public available data (for which they all should be the same), it seems like everyone makes up their own numbers. If I look for Coca Cola (KO) for example:

\- Morning Star: 92.4% ([https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/ko/dividends](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/ko/dividends))

\- Seeking Alpha: 77.38% ([https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO/dividends/scorecard](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO/dividends/scorecard))

\- Market Beat: 76.92% \[TTM\] / 76.19 % \[This year estimate\] ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/KO/dividend/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/KO/dividend/))

\- CSI Market: 65.08% ([https://csimarket.com/stocks/single\_dividendpr.php?code=KO](https://csimarket.com/stocks/single_dividendpr.php?code=KO))

If I calculate my own Ratio it gets even worse (EPS / DPS):

\- Nasdaq: 1.6 / 1.64  = 97.56% ([https://new.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ko](https://new.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ko))

\- Yahoo: 1.6 / 2.08 = 76.92% \[EPS 2.08 estimated for 2019\] ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO/key-statistics](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO/key-statistics))

\- Market Beat: 1.6 / 2.07 = 77.29% \[2.07 estimate for 2019\] ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/KO/earnings/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/KO/earnings/))

Another was ""flipping"" websites in the same way that you flip properties, or building ""internet properties"" from scratch -- here the meaning was mostly landing pages that were heavily SEO oriented with the sole purpose of bringing traffic for selling adspace (e.g. for several years a popular search term was ""asbestos"" and then there were thousands of one-pagers filled with words about it). Real content websites required more solid investment but also brought in potential revenue streams.

Can the current decrease in yield, be caused by a mixture of Trump Tweets and media overreacting. 

And if my theory is correct would it be wise to buy the short term bonds know since they are priced low and gain a much better return in the future.

cu23jc,Rental Properties: Is The Math Really As Bad As It Seems..?,"So one of my plans for investing and really building myself up in the future, was to invest in some rental properties, rent for x-amount of years until ROI, then sell.

But I got to thinking.. Picture a more modest investment property. A $125,000 smallish condo. At market rates in this particular area, it looks like I can get about $1,500 per month in rent. Fine.

Adding in taxes, monthly maintenance cost, and insurance, I ain't looking at much over $1,000 per month. And that's assuming nothing really goes wrong. And it will of course. That is an ROI of over 10 years!! And so, it all just seems like a fool's game.

Surely there's something I'm missing? The ROI on $1,500 counting ZERO COST is already garbage. So what, 12.5% yearly?

Michael Burry, the guy from The Big Short who made a killing shorting subprime mortgage bonds, is currently long 3% of GameStop (GME) and trying to start an epic short squeeze.

Over 50% of the outstanding shares are short and the company has enough cash on hand to buy back more than the entire market cap of the company. All they need to do to start a historical short squeeze is to get off their asses and start buying.

Plus, the PS5 and next-generation Xbox are launching next year, with support for physical discs. This is likely to lead to significant revenue growth in 2020 and 2021 and reinvigorate the business, at least temporarily.

Obviously, physical disc games are in secular decline, but I think this is going to take many, many more years. People still give physical console games as presents and it is likely to stay that way for a while.

They also sell collectibles and T-shirts, game accessories and various other things that are NOT in secular decline. The collectibles and accessories have been growing YoY.

GME is going to cut over $100M in SG&A expenses this year. They have a brand new CEO with a good track record that is currently cleaning house aggressively.

This stock is ripe for a short squeeze.

ctsh9a,(newbie question) am I understanding bonds and ROI correctly?,"I am new to finance and am trying to understand the basics of bond metrics

Say there is a bond with par value of $1000, 4% annual coupon and 10 years to maturity. Say the discount/market rate today is 1.5%, which would mean the price of the bond is $1230.55 

If I buy this bond today and hold it to maturity, regardless of what happens to future interest rates, I spend $1230.55 today and get a total cashflow stream of $40 per year \* 10 years + my principal back at the end, so a total of 400+1000= $1400

At this point, my brain would say, OK, I spent $1230.55 and got $1400, so $1400-1230.55= 169.45 of.....profit? If I divide this profit by my investment, I get 169.45/1230.55= \~14%. Or in other words, my ROI on this investment is 14%.....right?

Everything I read about bonds is that they are measured in yields, yield to maturity, etc. The current yield above would be 3.25% and 1.5% yield to maturity

I guess my question is.... the 3.25% and 1.5% figures make this investment seem fairly mediocre. However, where I work in the engineering field, a 14% proposed ROI on a new project or buying new/faster equipment would be considered pretty damn good. But projects take work and machines fail, so why would we move forward with anything if we could just buy those bonds and sit on our asses and collect 14%? Or in another way, the average S&P return over time is something like 11%..is a bond like this basically a free ticket to market beating returns? I guess Im confused as to why everyone fusses over the yields and interest rate changes which are tied to the secondary market, when buying a single digit coupon rate bond will almost always give you double digit ROI in the long run.

cths5q,Bond ETF - how does it work," 

Help me  understand an ETF Bond. When you buy a classical Bond, you know how much are you getting out of it when it expires. You have the coupon + face value - price.

Lets take a TLT ETF with 20+ Treasury Bonds for an example. It has 1000+ individual bonds dating back to 1999. Most of them have a coupon which is paid out every month, 3 months etc. OK. This is one way of generating money. The second part is the price of the bonds. When we take TLT apart, we see lots of bonds with negative yield or very poor yield. Sure, your TLT will generate some money since single bonds pay out the coupon, but the price of the bonds is really high. So hight that the yields are around 0. When they expire the ETF will get back less than it paid for it.

ctq75m,Discussion: Is the trend of retail stock consolidation/specialisation cyclical in nature?,"A common theme that I've detected is that people seem to have an issue with big department stores stocking too great a variety of inventory; people no longer seem to enjoy shopping at gigantic stores in malls that sell essentially everything. Rather, the current trend seems to be smaller, more specialised stores that people like to go to with the purpose of purchasing something specific (sneaker stores come to mind).

Therefore my question is: is this trend cyclical? Can the older ones among us recall a time when smaller, specialised stores were eschewed in favour of department stores that consolidated stock and allowed shoppers to buy many different categories of goods in one store? Do people think that after a set period of time big department stores will come back into fashion?

ctik0y,Peculiar Market Signals,"S&P 500 was at its all-time high on 26th July 2019 at 3,025. It is currently trading at 2,900 level, down about 4.1% from the peak but still +15.7% year-to-date.

Meanwhile, U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield declined from the 5-Year high of 3.2% in 4Q18 to 1.58% as of now. The sudden and sharp decline in 10-Year Treasury Yield pushed global bond prices to all time high as well. J.P. Morgan Asia Credit Bond Index also surged to all-time high with year-to-date return reach 11.7% as of 20th August 2019, **BEST PERFORMANCE IN 5 YEARS.**

Historically, strong economic growth has always been the main driver for rising stock prices. In a booming economy, investors normally increase their asset allocation to equity, reducing their exposure in bond, which usually yielding lower return as compare with equity in the long run.

This year, Federal Reserve reversed its Fed Fund Rate hike policy and cut 25bps (0.25%) in July-2019. This is widely anticipated and bond investors had already positioned themselves for a rate cut, which will push up bond prices.

However, equity markets are still doing very well with S&P 500 increased by 15.7% YTD.

The inverted yield curve, historically, signalling an upcoming recession as bond investors are will to “get paid” less in longer term debt securities while getting paid more in shorter term debt securities. If bond investors are right about where our global economy is heading to, then the equity markets investors are probably still in their sweet dream thinking that the fundamentals of the global economy will continue to do well.

Conversely, If equity investors are right that the global economy is going to do well, at least in the next 6-12 months, why would bond investors keep buying up bonds and pushing bond prices to all-time high?

**There could be 2 possible outcomes.**

1. Bond investors are right and equity market is set to fall.
2. Equity investors are right and bond prices are set to fall.

What is so peculiar at this juncture is that, nobody knows who will be right and everybody just continue this amazing party with the music playing so hot and loud. Many empirical evidences have shown that bond and equity exhibit negative correlation in the long run. The stellar performance of both bonds and equities post a very serious question. Which asset class will be the next out-performer?

GOLD? As claimed by many famous and credible investors recently. Gold price had risen 9.86% YTD. Almost every asset classes are performing well.

Let’s say there is a recession coming, equity is definitely going to suffer. What about bond prices? U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield is already at 1.58%, the lowest level we have ever seen since early 1960’s. Will bond remain a safe heaven if a recession is in the brewing?

When equity sell off starts, there will be more money flow from equity to bond, pushing up bond prices, hence pushing down bond yields.

If there is no recession in the next 6-12 months, bond prices may not fall that much as the rhetoric coming out of the white house is demanding more rate cut from Federal Reserve.

The strong performance YTD, up to 20th August 2019, will not repeat again. 2019 is a very special year with all the factors coincidentally or deliberately being put in place for a favourable market environment for both equity and bond markets.

I believe that it is very difficult at this juncture for both bond and equity investors to make the same stellar performance they had already achieved this year. Investors should be very careful in considering buying up more bonds or stocks. Either ways, there must be one asset class that will suffer.

My conclusion is that global market is flooded with too much liquidity. The inverted yield curve may not be an early predictor of an impending recession.

Just last week, Germany government announced that they have already prepared a stimulus plan if the ongoing trade war continues to negatively affecting its export oriented economy, on the pre-condition that Germany economy entering recession.

cth951,Should we be a little worried about Trump and the fed?,"Trumps been pressuring the fed but they have no obligation to listen. I’m new to this but I think they operate somewhat like the Supreme Court where they are mostly immune to political and public opinion. I have a fear that could change but I’m not sure if it’s valid. I think there’s a very good chance if a recession come by election time Trump is really going to go all in and bring the Fed into the public spotlight. My worry is as we get more populist there will be a movement to subject the fed to elections or give the government direct control over it. It probably could  be pretty popular too imo. The Fed is very important, presidents will blame them for everything wrong in the economy and the voters have the right to have a say who sits on the board. I think in that case it’s an absolute disaster, most of us are stupid and will vote for whoever is going to promise to juice the economy.. Throw in some lobbying and corruption and we have a real problem. 

So my question is: what’s the likelihood the fed could lose autonomy and if that happens how screwed are we having people run for a position few understand and running on messages that cater to average Americans that have no clue what the fed actually should do?

Has my risk / volatility tolerance changed because I've experience more of the market and hence know that its not a big deal any more? Or is it that a type of wealth effect where since I have more, I'm not as worried about losing some of it. 

Logically, losing 5% of $1000 isn't that different to losing 5% of 10,000 in the sense that you've still lost 5% of your wealth. If anything losing a bigger nominal number should scare an investor more. But intuitively, it makes sense in that even if you lose some you still have a bigger pie left over regardless.

cte8o5,Confusion about options,"Pretty new to trading, so I just wanted to clarify a burning question. I hear all the time about how options are supposedly more risky yet more rewarding than regular buying and holding. Why is this? 

If we take Apple as an example, and say their current share price is $50, and I think it will go up to $100, I could buy calls at a strike price of 75. However, if I straight up bought Apple I get a gain of 50 -> 100. Unless I set the strike price at or below the current share price, I will make less money. And to set it at or below isn't optimistic, while calls are inherently optimistic, so I'm confused. Is the only way to make huge gains rampant lowballing? Like if I set the strike price to $10, expecting the share price to go from 50 --> 100, so my gains are now 10 -> 100.

I fail to see how calls or puts are more risky and rewarding. Sure, if it expires, your money's dead and gone, but you are still able to control the same stocks with less skin in the game. I wouldn't consider this to be THAT much riskier. As I previously mentioned, the only way I see to make more than by standard buying and holding, is to set the strike price opposite to the outlook of your deal. So if you're buying calls, set it below the current price, and vice versa for puts. Optimistic call, pessimistic strike price, etc... 

So yeah, I'm confused. Am I missing something? Is my viewpoint flawed and ill informed? How did this perception of options being some sort of risky, rewardy endeavor get started? Is this perception even real and widespread, or have I wandered into the wrong echo chambers and been brainwashed?

Just want to be sure that I understood US T-bills correctly...

I can buy them through interactive brokers anytime. Let's say I buy today with maturity on 9/3/19. Yields around 1.9% and the price would be somewhere around 99$. You invest 1000$ ...means 1 t-bill.

What will happen on maturity date? 

From my understanding you get paid 1.9% yield on 1000$ on 9/3/19, right? Also you get your 1000$ back ..

So since this is the secondary market, does it matter that you maybe haven't bought the t-bill on auction day (but later) and will it still yield the % it showed on the day you purchased via your brokerage anyway?

Maybe someone can enlighten me on that topic ..many thanks!!",r/investing,1566296919.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cswcij/understanding_tbills/,eight141414,130,0.9,62,,False,788311,0,False,0,126

ct9lia,Why do yield curves invert?,"I feel really stupid because I've been trying to get this for a long time but I'm still not sure I understand why the yield curve inverts. Here are some explanations I've read: 

\- Investors expect short term yields to become lower (b/c the economy is slowing) so they buy more bonds at current coupons (a 2-year bought today will have a higher yield than a 2-year bought next week). Doesn't this push the yields on bonds lower??

\- Investors are leaving the stock market to go to short term bonds which causes increased competition driving the yield lower. This actually makes the most sense to me.

\- ""Expected price appreciation is a reason investors buy bonds even if yields are low."" I'm not even going to pretend I know what this means...

\- Yields in the U.S. are inverting because yields worldwide are inverting (this is sort of predicated that you know why yields in general invert).

ctjpoh,Taking out a loan to invest in the markets,"Wanted to get y'all opinions. Is a smart move to take out a loan to invest in the markets? 

I live in the UK and I've been accepted for a loan of £6,000 with APR (annual percentage rate) of 6.12% over 5 years.

This works out to about £953 in interest payments, around £115/month.

I'm trying to get more involved in investing to improve my understanding of the markets, in the hope the exposure will improve my knowledge and aid my job prospects for a move into investment management. I don't plan on investing it all at once, and will probably be a tad conservative (i.e ivest in ETFs instead of shares). 

I have a good paying job, where £115 in payments isn't really a noticeable outgoing for me. I already work in Financial Services. 

To those who will wonder why I just don't use my own capital: I've got majority of it tied up in an ISA (savings account), for my mortgage deposit. It'll probably be a while before I buy a house and even if I was in a position to do so before the loan is up, I'd just pay back the loan.

ctgjd7,Invest in the next big thing after bitcoin (if any),"So, what are your bets?

Personally I think bitcoin will survive, because the big money likes it. Bitcoin has the name and proven to be secure for 10 years now. But I don't believe in all those other public blockchain projects. They shout a lot, but even in this early stage of adoption they already suffer from performing. And be honest, which other project do you use yourself? Blockchain is not user friendly at all. And all those tricks to make it perform, makes it less decentralised which is the whole point of bitcoin.

So if I have to pick a project that can be the next big thing. I would pick a project with no blockchain at all! But something different, still unique, technical superior and it must have a lot of potential to beat the current king.

From all the non-blockchain projects I know of, I think the SAFE Network(MAID) is the best candidate.  [https://medium.com/safenetwork](https://medium.com/safenetwork)  It's a complete decentralised anonymous data/communications network(unique!) which has its own consensus mechanism called PARSEC(technical superior!). This one is much faster than blockchain and scales very well by design. On top of this network you can build anything you can do on the current internet(lot of potential!). It is easy to use because you can use webbrowsers/apps on PC or phone to access the network, just you are used to right now. 

It will have its own cryptocurrency(private and realtime transactions) which is kinda backed by the data and services on the network. Which makes it valuable as well.

An unique project, but very big and ambitious. Still in development. So there is risk, but risk means high rewards.

ctegca,I would like to debate about dividends pro's and con's,"Well, i was reading through subs about FIRE and investing and so on and i noticed one thing...

Almost everywhere are people against dividends... and i have read through their answers why they think that

There were basically two reasons:

1. When dividend is paid, the price goes down about the same amount, so it doesnt matter if you sell or get paid
2. Dividends are tax inefficient

Well, on the other hand pros of dividends:

1. When you are down on your portfolio, you dont have to sell with loss, you just cash dividends
2. Dividend aristocrats are less volatile and have better returns than S&P 500
3. You dont have to sell shares, you still has 100 shares which pays 4, instead of selling 4 shares
4. dividends are also raised, in aristocrats for last 25 years
5. when you get dividend, you can put it somewhere else, in position which is undervalued

I guess i could come up with more arguments, but i dont know them now... personally it feels much better to get dividends, than to have to sell shares...

I am not trying to be smarter than everyone, but all i hear is same old song... dividends suck, buy etf and thats it... i would like some form of debate...

The personal comment is because paying of mortgage as fast as you can is not always the best choice, if you have discipline to invest money that left... on the other hand, it must be really great feeling, which is very big plus to have that weight of you back...

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-whistleblower-told-sec-the-company-inflated-revenue-for-years-2019-08-19

I personally find this one a little hard to believe:

> Kuba’s whistleblower filings, which have been reviewed by MarketWatch, outline several ways employees allegedly boosted revenue, including recording fictitious revenue for complimentary golf rounds or for free guest promotions. Another alleged action Kuba described in her SEC filing involved recording revenue for $500 gift cards at their face value even when guests paid a discounted rate of $395.

And somehow this added up to $6bln in over-reported revenues:

>  In just one financial year, 2008-09, Disney’s annual revenue could have been overstated by as much as $6 billion, Kuba’s whistleblower filing alleges. The parks-and-resorts business segment reported total revenue of $10.6 billion in 2009, according to its annual report filed with the SEC.

Disney's response:

> The Disney spokesperson said: “The claims presented to us by this former employee — who was terminated for cause in 2017 — have been thoroughly reviewed by the company and found to be utterly without merit; in fact, in 2018 she withdrew the claim she had filed challenging her termination. We’re not going to dignify her unsubstantiated assertions with further comment.”

I am having a little regret and wondering what you think.  I invested a little on Td ameritrade.  I bought a decent selection of things I think are great investments; I plan on holding onto all those for possibly two or three decades.  Those are my long haul investments.  Now, I realize there is a $6.95 trading fee, versus a platform like Robinhood, where there are no fees.  So, with so many free platforms nowadays, is Td a waste of money on fees?  I'm trying to justify the money I spent on fees (just personal anxiety).  Td maybe is safer than Robinhood?  Which would be nice to have security on the platform, considering I want to hold onto them for a long time. 

I do want to invest in things that I could sell within a shorter period of time, and make a little profit.  I think Robinhood will be good for that (penny stocks, etc.).  What do you guys think?  Hope you're having a good day

I'm likely 40 years from retirement. Even if I was 100 percent in stocks and the market crashes tommorow, it would eventually come back.  Over 40 years that investment in all stocks should come back to beat a 90 in stocks 10 percent in bonds, assuming I just leave the money in their respective buckets.

Wouldn't it make sense to hold off on putting it into bonds until you are 15 ish years from retirement?

Or, is the point that you keep say 20 percent in bonds. Then in the event of a crash (like in '08) you sell the bonds to buy stocks while they are cheaper, then rebalance later.

I guess I'm confused as to why anyone would invest in bonds until they get closer to retirement. Because without timing the market drop it would be better to have all stocks in the long run (I think).

cs6pwh,"Recession fears, recession reality","I've been an investor through two of the past recessions. I can't say if another one is looming, near, or not close at all. My ability to predict the market is as bad as anyone's.

However, hearing all the fear and hype, and seeing the Great Flight to bonds and commodities and other instruments, it causes me to reflect on what I see happening now, vs. what I remember from the past.

So, when real recessions were underway here's what I remember:

1. People were not universally warning me to avoid stocks. If anything, bubble hype was so great that I was told I ""couldn't lose"" by investing in tech, or real estate, or whatever else was fashionable at the time. I remember one friend actually becoming angry when I suggested that real estate was as susceptible to market uncertainty as anything else.

2. My company stopped giving out bonuses and raises, for years. People were laid off during successive waves of ""restructuring"". Recruiters called less often. Jobs were harder to find. Many of my friends had difficulty finding new work, or were out of jobs for months. There was a feeling of things ""drying up"".

3. During the last recession, Europe became rather expensive to visit (1.47 EUR/USD in Dec 2008). In general, purchasing power felt like it was... less, though this could have just been psychological.

In short, the recession environment made life feel like it was becoming more difficult. Whereas in the current climate, borrowing is still easy, interest rates are low, recruiters are calling, companies  pay competitively, my friends are taking trips and vacations and spending their money. The only place I notice ""recession"" cropping up is in the news, over and over.

I'm hopeful it stays there, but it makes me wonder how much of this is just fear levels reaching a fever pitch. Which could, I imagine, provoke the very thing everyone is afraid of, if the market depreciates assets too severely and everyone begins to panic.",r/investing,1566160612.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cs6pwh/recession_fears_recession_reality/,jwiegley,1207,0.94,399,,False,788311,0,False,2,1209

ct2ae5,"I don’t think S&P 500 will continue 10% return, not because of doomsday predictions or economy, it’s the inflation.","So just to be perfectly clear, I’m not remotely qualified to predict the future of US markets so I’m not going to even bother. I do think the 10% will definitely decrease though based on a very simple observation of inflation. 

We have entered an age of much lower inflation, we don’t veer too far of the 2% mark these days. This is a good thing and actually better for investing in taxable accounts. Having a better control on inflation is also not bad for the markets so why will it return less than in the past. My simple reasoning that I believe is accepted as fact is that stocks do increase with inflation. They are companies, companies sell things, the prices of things they sell increase in price due to inflation. Most are aware of this and smart enough to think I need to subtract inflation from nominal gains to calculate what I’m really on track to have and what I’m going to need for $ in the future. So you take that 10% average and then subtract 2-3% inflation and arrive at the 7-8% in real gains.

The problem we are missing is the average 10% we use has a lot of gains from times when inflation was much higher but are subtracting today’s expected inflation. Due to the fact that inflation was higher back then the nominal gains also increased but their real gains were much lower. 

So not a the maker will be weaker expectation, actually better in taxable account because you pay taxes of nominal gains so lower nominal gain and lower inflation is better than higher nominal gain and higher inflation due to tax purposes. The real issue is we have skewed expectations. Unfortunately I can not find average real gains through stock market history but something to consider if you are expecting 7-8%.",r/investing,1566320757.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ct2ae5/i_dont_think_sp_500_will_continue_10_return_not/,csdspartans7,0,0.33,10,,False,788311,0,False,0,0
csh316,Why are risk free or near risk free investment returns so low these days?,"Bank accounts will sometimes get you 2% but that’s subject to change I believe, T Bills, CDs, etc are barely yielding anything unless you’re willing to lock up your money for a long time in which case stocks almost definitely outperform. To beat inflation again is near impossible on these safe investments again unless you have like a 20+ year hold period. 

To me this mostly makes sense, you trade less risk for less reward but I feel like maybe this should be higher? The government or whoever is giving out these bonds has to compete for your money and with a 10 year run like this I would think they’d have to offer more competitive returns, especially on long term investments where I think the best you can get is around 3.7% from a savings bond. That doesn’t really make sense at all considering the worst  20 year stock market return in history is 6.4% per year. This seems like the market is acting very inefficient to me. Savings bonds should absolutely never be purchased when their counterparts worst return in history has significantly better returns with much higher upside.  Basically no one should ever hold a 20-30 year government bond, if the market was efficient imo they would need to drastically boost the incentive for this product before anyone would buy one. 

I must be missing something here but for some reason, it didn’t always used to be this way. TBills for example used to have great returns, particularly early 80s which at one point yielded over 16% on 1 year maturities I believe. In fact rarely did TBills return less than 4% from 1960-2000.

So what caused these safe investments to drop so drastically over the last 10 years? Why is anyone buying them up? If they’re not why are they not raising the incentives to buy?",r/investing,1566221302.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/csh316/why_are_risk_free_or_near_risk_free_investment/,csdspartans7,25,0.77,25,,False,788311,0,False,0,24

csljvj,What are the most popular fundamental filters when screening for stocks?,"Hey everyone,

When you're using a site like Finviz or your favorite screener to filter specifically for companies that meet certain **fundamental** criteria (things like PE ratio, current ratio, revenue, cost of revenue, net income, operating cash flow, earnings per share, etc), which ones do you think are the most popular?

I'm sure tons of people search for companies based on earnings per share, operating cash flow, PE ratio, and many others but I'm trying to decide which ones are the most popular as a whole. It doesn't need to be exact, but the reason I'm curious is I'm working on building a fundamental stock screener right now and it has a button to enable ""popular"" filters. Right now I've just arbitrarily picked some but I've got about 130 different things it can filter on, and I want to go through my list and mark a few as ""popular"" so that people can just click the ""Popular"" button and show the most popular things to filter on.

So far I've marked these as popular:

    Assets
    Cost of Revenue
    Current Ratio
    Debt
    Earnings per Share
    Free Cash Flow
    Gross Margin
    Liabilities
    Market Cap
    Net Cash Flow/Change in Cash/Cash Equivalents
    Net Income
    Net Margin
    Operating Cash Flow
    Payables
    Price to Earnings Ratio
    Price to Sales Ratio
    Receivables
    Revenue
    
I'm sure there's plenty of others. I'm trying to lock in the ones that people will most likely use just as a quick preliminary search to start narrowing down the list of potentially interesting companies - which ones have I missed?

cslhil,Firstrade - did you see someone log into your account?,"Hi, I only just quickly read through the FAQs and didn't immediately say anything about this, I'm new to the sub so hopefully this is an okay post.

I'm in the US, east coast. Sunday in the middle of the night I received an email from Firstrade saying someone logged into my account from a new machine using Firefox. I found the email in the morning and thought it was a phishing attempt, so I logged in separately without clicking any links in the email, and upon logging in, Firstrade said the same thing. Login at 1:51AM.

I freaked out. Checked my history - nothing. Immediately changed my credentials. Submitted a customer service request (even though I knew they wouldn't respond until a weekday). Today I called them and waited on hold to get a rep. I brought the issue up, and they had a response ready to go.

""We were doing firewall tests over the weekend and used a variety of web browsers. Many accounts show that someone logged in as a result."" and ""This affected both personal and business accounts.""

I asked and confirmed that I was not the first person to call in with a concern. Okay. So they knew about this and had a response ready. But... this is super unusual. Doing a firewall test with real user's accounts on production sounds super fishy. You shouldn't be able to log in AS the user - passwords should be hidden. Unless they have some special means to circumvent a user's password (woah) or used some other method to trigger the login (still, woah). It almost sounds like covering up a data breach or something... I don't know.

But if any of you saw a login like I did, this may be why.

GE is fucked.

\--------

Fuck the news protecting their interests, here is the real story on GE if you don't already know.

Bill Gross (King of Bonds, Pimco) says in **2001** that GE's margins are a ""mirage"" and the consistent 15% achieved by Welsh as CEO is fake.

Imelt ousts Ken Langone from the board in **2005**. Langone is a co-founder of Home Depot (a proper company) and a hard-ass, no-bullshitter. They kicked him off the board because he was the only one asking tough questions. Langone [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_87LTdL_rI) on Dec 19, 2018 that GE is ""a disaster,"" mismanaged, with ""zero supervision"" from the board. ""They never did a retrospective on any deal they ever made while Imelt was running it."" ""This is a tragedy.""

Imelt sells NBC to Comcast in **2009**. At GE's current EBITDA, NBC would have a market capitalization of $80b—more than the GE parent company's current valuation.

**Also in 2009, GE pays** [a $50m fine to the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-178.htm) **for fraudulent accounting. They inflated their earnings by $1b to meet expectations.**

Imelt topdecks the oil market with the disastrous aqcuitistion of Lufkin in **2013**. While telling investors they are reducing the company's volatility, management triples-down on oil at the worst possible time.

Markopolos [warned the SEC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ferWor2a1oA) about Madoff's fraud for 8 years before the government finally acted.

Markopolos went on CNBC last Thursday to give [an explosive interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VCtB3E0JB0), in which he details a minimum of $30 billion in Fraud at GE and declares ""GE is heading for bankruptcy."" He indicates a four month timeline similar to Enron and Worldstar.

Markopolos follows up on Yahoo Finance [the same day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jE10T250bo). He clarifies that he self-funded for 7.5 months before taking the research to a fund who bought it. He says the he has given ""several smoking guns"" to the government. He revises extends his projected timeline for GE's collapse, saying ""they won't survive the next recession.""

I've been working exclusively within the junior mining world for over 12 years and barely felt a commodity bull market. Small glimpses here and there but never one like previous cycles. Now is different. 

As an industry we're guilty for not engaging and educating potential new investors about the opportunities, tribulations and what goes into this world. I hope to contribute as much as possible to engage, help educate and provide resources to guide anyone who's interested in learning about this great industry.

My number one lesson to you all is that this industry affords us to enjoy the lifestyles we have, want and envision. The world is dependent on minerals and as we grow it becomes more reliant on minerals and metals. If it's not grown, it's mined.

Pre-2008 I would tell you that it only takes 3 main pillars for a potentially successful junior mining company;

1) the right management team
2) the right project
3) ability to raise money

Post-2008 it takes a heck of a lot more to potentially have a successful junior mining company. Too much more elements to go through but it's mainly based on communication and education, transparency and visibility.

There are many books, public forums, articles and individuals that will help you learn about, grow with and feel more comfortable while you go down the forever road of due diligence. I'm still learning. I plan to be focused in this sector for the rest of my life and I'll still be learning till the day I die. Don't fear the unknown, embrace it.

cs5gsv,"A useless data point regarding ""Time in the market vs timing the market""","I think we're in a more uncertain time than we were, say, two years ago, and people might feel (rightfully) queasy about making further investments with markets near all-time highs, with the combination of global and political uncertainty.

Invariably, when they ask, the mantra is ""time in the market beats timing the market"", with the most common argument that if you missed the 10 or 20 best months the market had, you'd pay a steep price.

I hate just taking other peoples word for this, so I download historic data for the S&P 500 to check myself.

**Time in the market:**

if someone invested $10,000 on 1/1/1950 and let it sit, they would end up with $1,164,069 at the end of July 2019. Not bad, right?

**Timing the market (round 1 - the worst market timer):**

Next, we have the worst possible market timer, and they miss 20 of the S&P's best months, but otherwise slogged through it all. Their $10,000 would have grown to a measly $153,876 during that period.

So I guess that's it, right? Time in the market wins? Not so fast.

**Timing the market (round 2 - the best market timer):**

What about the best market timer of them all, who managed to miss the 20 worst months? Their reward from an initial $10,000 investment is a cool $11,682,636. We don't speak about them, though.

**Timing the market (round 3 - the best and worst all in one):**

Finally, we have a middle of the road type, who somehow sold out before the 20 worst months the market had, but they also sold out before the best 20 months as well. Their ending balance is $1,580,457. 

Is this an argument for timing the market? Sell out all your investments and sit in cash waiting for the next recession? No. The problem being, that none of us has the benefit of knowing what the future holds. We can guess at it, but if you follow the posts on /r/investing and nearly any other message board, the investing public goes through violent mood swings between total euphoria and total depression on a near daily basis. 

That said, I do think there are middle grounds, especially for those of us who are still building our retirement nest eggs. 

**Dollar cost averaging**

The first is simply dollar cost averaging. We do this automatically, through our bi-weekly payroll deductions. We're not buying the top or bottom of the market, we're just contributing a like amount at regular intervals, insuring that we're buying when stocks are both expensive and cheap.

When people look at their nest eggs, they see the amount they've invested so far, and seem to disregard what they're putting in. You might be 100% stock in your portfolio, but if you're on track to contribute 25% of the value of your portfolio this year in new contributions, you might as well look at your portfolio as between 66-75% equity and 25-33% cash.

**Asset allocation**

There are many different allocation ideas around here, ranging from Bogle, to Swensen, to Dalio, and probably others that are even more complicated.

The great thing about any of those is, if you're diligent, you're practically guaranteed to be be buying cheaper assets and selling your appreciated assets (which is: buy low, sell high). The only issue is the psychological one, where people might not want to sell their winners in order to buy their losers (""why should I sell treasuries to buy equities when treasuries are doing so well""?). So again, some diligence is needed here. 

I personally HATE treasuries as long term investments, but I hold them as a hedge against uncertainty, so I'm always happy to ""have"" to sell treasuries to buy equities. Conversely, when market changes are forcing the sale of equities to buy treasuries, I kind of applaud myself for getting to sell high. 

**Personal experience**

I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't say what I've actually been doing, I think. So yes, in 1 portfolio, I got to sell treasuries for equities recently.

In the other, which has exposures to everything, I did revert to a 10% cash position. I did maintain my allocation targets, so I sold fewer treasuries than equities comparatively, but while I felt it important to always have some market exposure, I've also decided that I might want to take the following few months to average back in. And, going back to the political, if in December, the tariffs against China rhetoric is heating up, I'll probably do the same thing all over again, raise some cash and then immediately start averaging back in over the next few months.

Is this strategy smart? Time will tell. And in all honesty, probably not. I'm a little ahead of where I would have been so far this month, but maybe even by the end of the months, I'll regret it. Point being, even if you lay out the most perfect of plans, sometimes your own psychology is the biggest enemy of them all.

Anyways, this all started because I keep reading the ""time in the market vs timing the market"" mantra, and wanted to dig a little deeper than ""what if you missed the X best months"" to see if you'd managed to avoid bad months as well as a mixture between the two. Maybe you all will find it interesting, who knows.",r/investing,1566154993.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cs5gsv/a_useless_data_point_regarding_time_in_the_market/,suddenly_saving,0,0.52,20,,False,788311,0,False,0,2

crtkq1,For Fun: Who is the secret Hedge Fund backing the GE short ?,"  

Just for Fun I wanted to put his post together (as a speculated guess) to uncover the Hedge fund backing the GE short.

It was recently disclosed that Harry Markopoulos has disclosed a potential accounting fraud in GE. He is backed by an undisclosed Hedge Fund.

I believe this hedge fund to be Pershing Square Capital Management (PSCM) Bill Ackmans fund because;

   
 

1. PSCM recently took a position in Berkshire Hathaway. (one of the biggest; best capitalised and most liquid insurers in America). GE is exact opposite, one of the worst capitalised insurers with little tolerance on the balance sheet for write downs, economic downturns and questions around the capital reserves.

The BRK position would act as the natural hedge to the GE short position.

If not GE what else is the hedge for his Berkshire trade??? PSCM is a hedge fund after all.

   
 

2. PSCM has been hit with reputational damage and regulator issues on the Herbal Life short in a past trade. 

Bill has mentioned in the media that he will be reluctant to approach a stock short in the same manner as Herbal Life due to reputational risk and also the risk that regulators are reluctant to investigate a company as the shorting Hedge Fund profits from the mere appearance of an investigation. 

To mitigate/avoid this risk, Bill has said instead PSCM will disclose in private to the regulator rather than make public disclosure. Markopoulos has said the regulator was informed before the August public disclosure.

   
 

3. Where is Bill Ackman? 

Normally Bill is in the media discussing/detailing the PSCM new positions. 

Also, in my opinion, Bill would likely oblige the media by publicly disclosing to the market that PSCM is not the Hedge fund shorting the GE stock, given point 2 above.

Bill's absence from the media is quite telling me.

Using Markopoulos to publicly disclose the trade is a shrewd/novel way of getting around this. 

   
 

4. Why would a Hedge Fund care if their publicly short a beaten up stock like GE?

Isn't the point of Hedge Funds to be long and short stocks and be market neutral - see point 2.

(I will defer that regulator issues may be one).

   
 

I did think the PSCM was the most likely from T+6hrs from the first disclosure so I may have had inbuilt bias. But we will see. This is just for fun with bit of logic and public knowledge, no more than Markopoulos has done for his research. 

(It really doesn’t matter who the Hedge Fund is)

crmc9s,Understanding Yield Curve Inversion (x-post from r/finance),"Hello Fam, I'm noticing a lot of information and misinformation on yield curve inversion of US Treasury curve so I thought we should all do a quick exercise together to best understand how it all works.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",r/investing,1566049679.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/crmc9s/understanding_yield_curve_inversion_xpost_from/,takeitor_leaveit,38,0.9,6,,False,788311,0,False,0,38

As of right now, I have a 401(k) via my employer which matches 5% I also just opened both a Roth IRA as well as a regular taxable investment account both through Betterment. I also have an account with Worthy (which is a 5% bonds for small businesses) and an account with Fundraise which is for Real Estate investments.

I have also been saving up cash in general apart from these things.

Is there anything I should be doing differently particularly as a value investor or does this seem like an overall good start for someone still in college? Unfortunately, as of right now I can’t invest more than I would like so I am seriously trying to save up as much money per month so that I can set some of it aside to invest as much as possible.",r/investing,1566061259.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/crora8/am_i_on_the_right_track/,Crazrwire999,4,0.7,9,,False,788311,0,False,0,4

Last month the U.S. Treasury laid out its plans to borrow $814 billion between July and December, after the Trump administration and Congress agreed to a two-year postponement of the U.S. debt ceiling, ensuring no government shutdown or a federal default.

Amid the stock-market rout, the chances of a half-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate in September rose to 30.4%. Markets are pricing in a 69.6% chance of a quarter-point rate cut next month.

Up to 40% of investors are now using index funds and thus those stocks get more support.

At the root of the market is buying/selling regardless of the company or the news, if everyone bought the worst stock on the exchange it would go up.

A lot of the volatility and crashes are due to our own making (investors).  If we would just keep buying regardless of news things would go up.  Of course I know we need to sell small amounts during retirement/major purchases and rebalancing.

At the same time, I know that the economy in general has an impact.  If there are fewer jobs then people have less to invest.

So is most of the market movement (especially in the down direction), is due to institutional investors and hedge funds who are using news, market theories, etc. that is totally unrelated to the fact that if everyone keeps buying it would be better for all.",r/investing,1566096366.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/crvs23/sp500_is_unnaturally_favored_due_to_the_increase/,socratessmon,0,0.4,10,,False,788311,0,False,0,0
crortc,What is the best way to participate on further rising gold prices?,"A buddy of mine is curious about investing in gold (long) and asked me what financial instrument to use. I myself have some knowledge on stocks and basics on options. 

He showed me JE00BYQY4X40 which is a 3x long ETF on the bloomberg gold subindex. I have trouble giving him advice as i dont understand all investment possibilities there are. 

Basically he could buy 1. the commodity physically 2. related stock e.g. gold mines 3. future contracts 4. call options on futures 5. ETF on futures right?

He wants leverage (single digit is enough) and not hold the commodity itself, so 1. and 2. are out. Additionally his time horizon is roughly one year. What are the pros and cons of investing via 3, 4 or 5? (ignoring his limited knowledge). 

I guess the BCOMGCTR index itself is used to avoid having to roll the futures oneself, but if it is what are the reasons to invest via an ETF and not options on the index itself? The cost the ETF has for constructing the leverage shouldnt be higher than doing it oneself via options right?

My last question is a basic one. I remembered something about futures contracts reflecting the market estimation on the price development of the underlying for point X in the future and e.g. if the gold spot price moved 5% in 1d and the market expected 3% the future would only rise 2%. Has this statement merit in any context or how does it come into play for futures?

crxcmh,19 and trying to get into investing,"I've spent the past few months reading a slew of books about the stock market and investing, learning as much as I can from established investors in my region who happen to have YouTube channels, and I will dip my toes into a stock market simulator (atm Investopedia's one seems like a good option) once I am confident enough. I'm currently relying on my parents for money, they think it's better more me to capitalise on the free time I have to learn about investing and finance in the long run. 

But I have a bit of a problem. From everything I know so far, day trading is a BAD option to anyone who is new to the market. Personally, I would very much prefer to invest rather than day trade, it's far more practical for me because I am a student and my priority is my education, and the degree I am doing is far from anything related to finance). But my parents disagree very strongly and are pressuring me to go into day trading instead of long term, conservative investing. I'm not sure how to go around this, and because I trust my parents' judgement I find myself questioning my own. I am still, at the end of the day, only 19. So here are my questions:

1. What do you recommend I do with the situation above?
2. What other resources would you recommend I learn from?
3. How would you recommend I start out? (I am willing to put in a considerable amount of time into studying rather than speculating when I can, but my time is limited by the fact that I am a full time university student. So yes, dollar cost averaging IS the easiest thing to do, but I would rather not stop there.

In 401k and IRA, your money is taxed as income which is bad isn’t it? I know 401k matching is good and then it can be rolled over to an IRA. Even though you can trade without having to worry about taxes right away, you have to pay extra in taxes when you take the money out anyway (or put money in for a ROTH IRA), so I’m not sure the advantage.

crhrtr,"Take pension lump sum and invest, or just leave it as is","My former employer is giving me an option to take the pension as a lump sum ($32.9K), or receive a monthly check for life starting at my ""normal retirement date"", estimated at $896/month at age 65.

From basic calculations: I'm in my late 30s. Assuming that I'll live till 87, so by that age:

1. from 65 onward, with the monthly check, i will have received 236.7K by age 87.
2. if i take the lump sum, invest into index funds and leave it until 60, then take it out and leave in vanguard bond etf. Assuming the bond etf returns 2% per yr, then i'd need the index to return \~6.6% annually to match the number in (1)

Pros for taking the lump sum & invest: 

1. Historically, the S&P 500 returns around 8%, so seems like this approach would most likely give me a higher amount than the monthly payments.
2. More control over what to invest (although this could also backfire)

Cons against taking lump sum:

1. I already have a 401K and Roth IRA, so a lot of my retirement money is dependent on the stock market. Would be nice to have an income stream independent of the stock market. (I see my estimated pension amount in fidelity, so I'm assuming my employer handed it over to fidelity)
2. Currently, in many parts of the world, the bond rate is negative. So if the US follows, that 2% rate for bond might not be possible.

Are there other considerations that I'm missing?

There is some overlap with these, like Amazon for consumer and enterprise, but hopefully this is clear 

**Enterprise Tech**   
Reason: I work for a large tech company and see these products being used and mostly liked everyday   
Examples: AMZN, HUBS, ZEN, TWLO, ADYEN, MSFT, ZM, DATA, CRM

**Consumer Tech Infrastructure**   
Reason: Providing the infrastructure and services for SMB   
Examples: SHOP, SQ, WIX, APPF, PYPL

**Restaurants/Retail with a loyal following**   
Reason: They have a loyal following and are growing   
Examples:  SHAK, CMG, SBUX, COST, LOW

**Consumer products with a loyal following**   
Reason: Products we use and have great experiences with   
Examples:  YETI, CHWY, DIS, LULU, AAPL

**Financial Services**   
Reason: High margin businesses   
Examples:  V, BAC, AXP, JPM, PAYX

**Dividend Aristocrats**   
Reason: Dividend stocks that continue to increase their payouts and have beaten VTSAX last 5 years   
Examples:  MKC, SHW, MCD, AFL, SYY

There are a few funds that capture a lot of these, of course VTSAX but also XSW and NOBL, but wanted to also put some money into individual stocks

cquxxk,Why yields are crashing further today and potentially the biggest market catalyst of the year or even decade....,"As we all know, the ECB essentially said that they going to start juicing up the economy hardcore and by no coincidence, Powell ordered a media blackout barring any Federal Reserve staff member from making any public comments on monetary policy - this is why yields have been crashing at an alarming rate in additional to yesterday's plunge as investors flocked for the worst possible scenario. (yield's plummeted yesterday because of a terrible gdp print from germany yesterday and a whole slew of recent economic data misses)

This hasn't been publicized much, there's only one article about it but it's pretty much spooked everyone on wall street as investors continue to panic bid on long-term treasuries - https://spectator.us/media-blackout-fed-jay-powell/

There are essentially two scenarios that could play out

1) Fed says its time to pump up the economy because recession signals are getting spooky and economic health globally is at a stand-still. they'll signal further rate cuts (remember they've hinted at last month's meeting that they don't expect any rate cuts for the rest of the year which is why the market tanked even after cutting rates). This will send equities to the moon as this is what the market wants. The market is currently pricing in at least an additional 50 bps of rate cuts by the end of this year - https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html

2) The Fed says that they can't afford to cut rates without ruining their balance sheet and they've essentially exhausted all options to stimulate the economy and that an intentional correction needs to happen for the sake of the long-term health of the economy - obviously this would destroy the market and we might see another black swan event similar to December's unprecedented decline

The media blackout itself is very weird. federal reserve members typically have blackout periods for specific dates before FOMC meetings but this one is essentially considered permanent until further notice which is unprecedented. in my opinion, scenario 2 is currently the most likely outcome - the media blackout suggests that powell and his crew are seriously considering giving up on cutting rates and believe a correction is necessary for the long-term health of the economy but such implications are so material in nature to the market that any on or off-the-record remarks regarding those discussions need to be silenced

anyways keep your eyes peeled for september's FOMC meeting and hedge your holdings accordingly. this is gonna be a rocky rest of the year - we also have political primaries coming up, September drug pricing vote which could ruin pharma/biotech and more

crgw4h,What will US stock markets do next week (Aug 19 - 23)?,"A number of patterns are visible in the US stock markets since Aug 1 when Trump announced 10% tarrifs on remaining goods imported from China.

1. After a major decline (600 points or more), the next day will be a small up-day (roughly 100 to 150 points), and the following day will be a moderate to high up-day (roughly 200 to 300 points).
2. If the market has more than 2 consecutive down days of significant decreases (300 to 500 points), expect that Trump will tweet about positive US/China trade news. For example, Trump's tweet on August 13 about delaying 10% tarrifs on some goods until mid December.
3. Mondays have been down days.

Knowing these patterns can really help your trading.

So what does this mean for next week (Aug 19 to 23)? Well, Monday Aug 19 should be down, likely 300 to 400 points. Then, we'll have to see what happens on Tuesday to know what Wednesday and Thursday will be like.

cqspqm,Why now is a great time to buy and fears are overblown,"Everyone is talking about inverted yield curve. But that means little in today's highly distorted markets. Plus it means little for your stock returns.

A list of yield curve inversions:

https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/df/dff1d52be616b4fd6a2d822acc04c8c7.png

If you go here:

https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/

The 1968 inversion would have yielded a 1.2% real return for 5 years and a -2.8% return for 10 years.

The 1973 inversion would have yielded a -3% real return for 5 years and a 1.2% return for 10 years.

The 1978 inversion would have yielded a 5.6% return for 5 years and 8.1% return for 10 years.

You see that after september 1980, for 5 years you would have made a 8.6% return after inflation and for 10 years a 10.7% return.

Now the next inversion happened in December 1988, again 5 and 10 year returns of S&P500 were 10% and 15% respectively.

the yield curve inversion in february would have caused a 3% annual loss for 5 and 10 years. 

And the 2006 inversion would have given a 0.5% annual return and a 5.6% return.

A lot of those bad returns can be explained by high valuations though. In the 60's and 70's PE ratio was nearly 20x while inflation was sometimes as high as 12%. Obviously 17x earnings with 5-6% inflation is way more expensive than 21x earnings with 1-2% inflation. 

And in 2000 PE ratio was nearly 28x vs 21x now, so valuation was 30% higher than it is now.

https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio/table/by-month

So even if a recession happens (less likely because of the distorted bond markets due to the FED) you would not even lose money a lot of the time over 5-10 year stretches. And valuation today of S&P looks better (with more international exposure, so more diversification) if you account for low inflation rates.

Key takeaways:

- recessions don't immediately follow inversion
- median market peak occurs 19.3 months after inversion
- median returns between inversion and peak = 22.3%

cr1zn3,If you actually read the WeWork S1..,"Reading some of the comments regarding WeWork was mind numbing so let me get a few points across:

- The unit economics of their underlying business is actually quite profitable, 6 months to breakeven for each property and full maturity within 24 months 
- Not even close to saturation yet
- 1/3 the cost for customers to house their employees is a no brainer 
- Yes losses increased by 25% but revenues grew 100%!
- Enterprise customers are now 40% and on an uptrend
- The levers they have to increase profitability are there, they mentioned pausing UK expansion because of Brexit and noted that capacity quickly reached over 90% before they resumed expansion



**Why I think it's still likely to be a bad stock**:

- Valuation likely to be crazy high
- Owner seems dodgy
- Corporate Governance seems shit
- No clear plan for when they expect to stop growth phase and focus on profitability - I think they could do this tomorrow if they wanted to, but prefer to continue growth for the foreseeable future which I think is risky but not stupid



Lots of companies have negative earnings but high growth rates and are positioned to become market leaders/disruptors, hence have high valuation multiples. Oracle and Symantec are huge companies with positive earnings but are run like shit and have no growth hence they aren't valued on the same multiples as say Atlassian or OKTA.

Point is that seeing one big negative earnings number or reading about how the business works on CNBC but not actually taking a look at the underlying numbers and saying it is a bad company means nothing at all without context.

I know that dividend capture shouldn't work, but investors generally respond positively to dividend raises and bid the stocks up, and dividend growers are known to outperform the broader market over time anyways. What if you bought NOBL constituents before the ex-dividend date, sold each at the average time it takes each stock to reach its pre-ex-dividend date price, and shorted SPY over the entire time you held each stock? That way you would have zero net exposure at all times, on average get slight outperformance from being long the dividend grower and short the broader market, and hopefully on average sell the stock at less of a loss than you gain in the dividend payment.",r/investing,1565928995.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cr16ux/an_idea_market_neutral_dividend_capture/,thisistheperfectname,1,0.67,3,,False,788311,0,False,0,1

In a pair of tweets, the president argued the central bank and its “clueless” Chair Jay Powell have dragged on the U.S. economy. He also blamed the Fed for the yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury moving higher than the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury — a possible recession indicator that contributed to U.S. stock indexes dropping more than 2.5% on Wednesday. 

Trump also claimed “we are winning, big time” in his administration’s trade conflict with the world’s second largest economy. “China is not our problem,” but rather “our problem is with the Fed” and its interest rate policy, he said.",r/investing,1565810992.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cqel86/trump_hammers_clueless_jay_powell_and_the_fed/,coolcomfort123,281,0.93,271,,False,788311,0,False,0,284

cqufv3,Drugmaker wants billions from Mylan related to EpiPen rival,"Drugmaker Sanofi wants Mylan to pay it up to $11.7 billion in damages, alleging Mylan employed anticompetitive tactics to snuff out Sanofi’s failed EpiPen rival Auvi-Q.

The contentious federal suit began in 2017. Sanofi revealed the $11.7 billion damages claim in a recent filing issued in response to Mylan’s motion for summary judgment to dismiss the case.

The figure is based on estimated lost profits during Auvi-Q’s first brief appearance on the market plus lost profits for the time since – $3.9 billion total – with antitrust law triple damages applied.

“This is a classic antitrust case,” Sanofi said, “involving a monopolist driving its competitor out of the market through anticompetitive conduct for no legitimate business reason other than to maintain its monopoly power.”

Mylan supplied this statement to The Dominion Post regarding Sanofi’s latest move: “Mylan has moved to dismiss Sanofi’s case regarding EpiPen Auto-Injector. In response, Sanofi filed a brief on Friday, Aug. 9, which uses highly inflammatory language and relies on irrelevant evidence in an attempt to support a legally indefensible case and exorbitant and speculative damages claims.

“Mylan continues to believe that Sanofi’s claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously. The company will file its reply to Sanofi’s brief on Aug. 30.”

More than 1,800 documents have been filed in the case since it opened in April 2017. Many are heavily redacted and more recent filings delve deep into the legal weeds. Here is a broad overview.

EpiPen and Auvi-Q are both epinephrine auto-injectors, abbreviated EAIs throughout the suit. EpiPen was launched in 1980; Mylan began marketing it in the U.S. in 2007.

French firm Sanofi launched the Auvi-Q in 2013. Unlike the tube-shaped EpiPen, the Auvi-Q is about the width and length of a credit card and as thick as a cell phone. Mylan officials had previously said that the EpiPen had an 85 percent market share through most of 2015.

Sanofi recalled the product and took it off the market in November 2105 because of technical problems with the dosage system. When Sanofi withdrew Auvi-Q, EpiPen’s share reached 95 percent.

In 2016, Sanofi returned Auvi-Q’s rights to developer kaléo, which brought it back to market in February 2017.

In the suit, Sanofi said its EAI was “designed for the smartphone generation to be smaller and easier to carry than the EpiPen.” It also included built-in voice instructions for use. It quickly gained traction in the marketplace.

In response, Sanofi alleged, Mylan erected multiple artificial barriers to stifle competition:

— Mylan offered steep rebates – 30% or more – to commercial insurers, pharmaceutical benefits managers and states (together called third-party payors) on the condition they do not reimburse for Auvi-Q prescriptions. With ripple effects on doctors, patients and caregivers, Auvi-Q was effectively shut out of more than 50 percent of the market.

— Mylan misclassified its EpiPen to federal and state Medicaid agencies, allowing it to under-reimburse those agencies for EpiPen sales and use the savings to fund its third-party payor rebate scheme.

— Mylan locked competitors out of schools by conditioning its EpiPen4Schools program on exclusive use of EpiPens (a requirement later withdrawn). Mylan spent $4 million lobbying Congress to pass the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act and at least $1 million more lobbying states. One major cheerleader was Gayle Manchin, mother of Mylan CEO Heather Bresch.

— When Auvi-Q hit the market, Mylan jacked up the EpiPen price, which also jacked up the available third-party payor rebate; while Sanofi had its own rebate program, it couldn’t match Mylan’s discount without losing money on each sale, so it was effectively locked out. Payors told Sanofi Mylan’s rebate exceeded Auvi-Q’s total projected sales.

— Mylan used its efforts to keep payors from covering Auvi-Qs as the source for a campaign to highlight that payors weren’t covering Auvi-Qs, harming Auvi-Q’s reputation and perception.

Because of those barriers, and some others, Sanofi said, its U.S. market share fell from 13% at the end of 2103 to just 7% in 2014.

Sanofi said Mylan’s annual EpiPen revenue topped $1 billion starting in 2013. “Thus Mylan had a strong economic motive to undertake the anticompetitive conduct … to protect its crown jewel branded drug project by all means necessary.”

Mylan filed its own counterclaims, alleging Sanofi was the one to engage in anticompetitive conduct.

In the counterclaim, it noted that when it acquired the EpiPen in 2007, there was little awareness of anaphylaxis risk and doctors often prescribed ineffective products to address allergic reactions. Mylan spent millions education the medical community and the public, and making the EpiPen available to schools.

But Sanofi undertook a campaign to besmirch the EpiPen and mislead the healthcare community and the public, Mylan said:

— Sanofi falsely advertised the Auvi-Q as the “new EpiPen,” more patient friendly, safer, easier to carry and use. Its agents allowed some providers to infer that EpiPen was phasing out of the market.

— Auvi-Q sales staff sometimes threw away EpiPen materials in medical offices and replaced it with their own.

— At least one sales staffer offered providers cash kickbacks for prescribing Auvi-Qs. This staffer was not fired, but transferred, implying Sanofi approved of the conduct, and the conduct was more widespread.

“Mylan Specialty suffered, and continues to suffer, harm to its brand image and reputation due to Sanofi’s willingness to engage in illegal activities” to build the Auvi-Q customer base at Mylan’s expense.

The case is in Kansas District Court. For now, a jury trial is set for April 13, 2021

I will not be re-investing the dividends, the dividend income will be used for expenses.

So I'm looking for some feedback on the stocks I've chosen for this purpose. I'm looking for high yield stocks but I an also looking for stocks with a history of increasing dividends and that seem highly likely to continue paying their dividends. I also tried to spread things out to different areas. I am worried that 30% in REITs is too high but the high yields in REITs are very attractive for what I'm trying to do. The three REITs I chose are in different areas of the real estate game at least, for some diversification. Two of my 10 stocks are renewable power utilities which may be a bit risky. I'm a little worried about how ABBV could be effected by healthcare changes in the future and that over half of their profits come from one drug (Humira).

These 10 stocks average a 7% yield which is crazy high. And I know I'm being a bit greedy. Tell me how I'm fucking everything up.

I have decided I want to start investing a bit of my money into stocks and I am trying to work out the best broker. I have emailed Ally invest and got this in return:

We charge a flat rate of $4.95 regardless of share amount for any stock valued at $2 or more. When trading penny stocks valued below $2 we charge $4.95 plus $.01 per share. We do cap the total commission charge for stocks valued at $2 or less at 5% of the total principal value of the trade. All option trades are $4.95, plus 65 cents per contract. There is only one base charge for multi-leg option-only trades.

> While total student loan balances decreased slightly, from $1.49 trillion to $1.48 trillion in the quarter, the share of those loans being left unpaid for several months increased.

> Payments on some 9.9% of student loan balances started being at least 90 days late during the three months that ended in June, compared with 9.4% in the January-March period. 

> A comparable measure shows credit card users, too, are falling behind. Payments on about 5.2% of those balances were 90 days overdue in the latest quarter, up from 5.0% in the first quarter. The figure has been on the rise since 2017. Similar delinquency rates declined for auto loans, home equity lines of credit, mortgages and other debt categories. 

> But fears the U.S.-China trade war and other issues could cloud that economic picture led the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 late last month.

cqeubb,Advice on long term strategy?,"Hi everyone 

Just wanted some advice on the strategy I took. However please note that I don't bet on Wall Street but in my own country. 

I recently bought 200 stocks of a company that went in stock recently. This company has been working on a process to produce isobuten from wastes made during production of sugar.

They are the only ones knowing this process and recently asked an increase in capital of 27 Millions as an investment in building a plant. In this increase, a worldwide major in cosmetics took a major part of this increase.

The beginning of the construction of the plant is not yet announced and the stock went from over 20€ to under 4 this week. When I bought it, I bought it at 4,60. Some predict that it would decrease to around 2€ before increasing again, and some, more pessimistic, think that before the end of the construction, a new process will be found and the stock will never go up.

Should I reinforce at price like 3.50 then 3 then...?

cpst6g,WSJ: Falling Bond Yields Make Equities Hard to Ignore,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/falling-bond-yields-make-equities-hard-to-ignore-11565688603?mod=mhp

> Nearly 60% of S&P 500 stocks offer dividend yield of at least 1.7%, beating 10-year U.S. Treasurys.

A plunge in bond yields has left investors with few alternatives to stocks.

The latest flare-up in trade tensions has quickened investors’ flight to haven assets, pushing bond yields down to their lowest levels in years. Wall Street analysts say the pullback in yields, along with a new phase of monetary loosening by central banks around the world, should give investors a new rallying cry for the second half of the year: “There is no alternative” to stocks, known as the Tina effect.

Nearly 60% of stocks in the S&P 500 offer a dividend yield of at least 1.7%, according to FactSet, better than the 1.640% yield where 10-year U.S. Treasurys settled Monday. AT&T Inc., T -0.17% cereal maker General Mills Inc. GIS 0.65% and memory chip company Western Digital Corp. WDC -0.17% are among the highest-yielding—and best performing—stocks in the index this year. Each has dividend yields of at least 3.6%, while yields across the broad index average about 2%.

The percentage of outperformers is among the highest of the more-than-a-decade-old bull market, says Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services. He added that, on average, about 17% of S&P 500 stocks have carried dividend yields exceeding those of 10-year Treasurys since 1990.

The allure of steady, income-generating stocks is expected to be a stabilizing force for major indexes in the months to come.

“This is a hard period for most investors to navigate through,” says Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “But stocks are supported by low bond yields as long as we don’t have a recession.”

A mix of trade tensions and fears that growth is slowing around the world have dented the stock market’s rally. The S&P 500 has stumbled 3.3% so far this month, knocking its year-to-date gain to 15%. Investors, meanwhile, have stepped up their flight to haven assets, pushing bond yields down.

During the pullback, analysts at UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo Investment Institute, among other firms, have been urging investors to buy dividend-generating stocks, especially those that are less susceptible to trade tensions.

Dividends pad stock returns and offer investors a steady stream of income. Taking dividends into account, an S&P 500 index that measures total return is down just 2% this month and remains up nearly 18% for the year.

Dividend-paying stocks can help insulate investors from the worst of a pullback. When the S&P 500 fell 6.6% in May following renewed trade anxieties, a UBS portfolio including Home Depot Inc., HD -1.43% McDonald’s Corp. MCD -1.80% , JPMorgan Chase JPM -1.88% & Co. and other dividend-paying stocks with below-average exposure to China fell a more modest 3.7%.

Investors, however, need to consider more than just a company’s share payout, according to analysts. Some of the highest-dividend-yielding stocks are among the market’s worst performers this year. In some cases, yields are higher because stock prices have fallen. Too high of a yield can be a sign of distress. The dividend yield of the telecom company CenturyLink Inc. CTL 3.90% stands at 9.3%, but shares have slid 26% in the midst of broader turmoil for telecoms.

S&P 500 energy stocks carry a yield of 3.8%, the highest of the broad index’s 11 major sectors. But worries of a supply glut have hurt shares of energy stocks this year. The sector has slid 8.9% since the end of June, cutting its year-to-date gain to 1.3%.

The disconnect between dividend yields and bond yields can be a factor of tepid economic growth, and it can spill over into the stock market. Take Japan, for example. The Nikkei 225 has had a higher dividend yield than what is offered by 10-year Japanese government bonds for more than a decade, but modest economic growth has weighed on returns. The S&P 500 has risen more than 700% over the past 30 years, compared with a 40% contraction in the Nikkei.

“Markets have to be very confident about the future, as well as the stability of a dividend going forward,” says John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management.

Investors should seek companies that have solid growth trajectories and pay healthy dividends, rather than those that offer the biggest payouts, says Mr. Vail. Utilities and consumer-staples companies, for example, pay some of the highest dividends, but those companies have been fighting pricing pressures and tend to grow more slowly than those in the technology and communications sectors.

Technology companies in the S&P 500 sport a dividend yield of 1.4% and have risen 25% this year, as investors concentrate on companies with the potential to expand sales and profits.

Apple Inc. AAPL -0.25% carries a 1.4% dividend yield, matching the broader sector’s average, and is up 27% for the year (nearly 29% on a total-return basis). Several companies that pay richer dividends are doing just as well, if not better. Semiconductor company Lam Research Corp. LRCX 0.51% has a 2.3% yield and is up 44% this year, while International Business Machines Corp. ’s 4.6% yield juices the computing giant’s total return to 22%, compared with 18% on the basis of price change.

At the same time, stock valuations have improved as major indexes pull back from their July records—an enticing factor for price-conscious investors who thought shares of many companies were getting expensive.

The S&P 500 is trading at 16.3 times its earnings over the next 12 months, down from more than 17 times in July, according to FactSet. Analysts at Goldman Sachs and other firms say the broad index could comfortably reach a valuation of 18 times by year-end, as long as interest rates fall or remain stagnant.

“Dividend yields are going to come into play for people looking to nibble at opportunities in the stock market,” says Mr. Lerner. “Even if you’re more bearish, then equities that pay dividends are going to help buffer portfolios during periods of uncertainty.”",r/investing,1565701195.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cpst6g/wsj_falling_bond_yields_make_equities_hard_to/,ryeander,36,0.78,39,,False,788312,0,False,0,37

Imagine that you know that event ""A"" will cause a reaction in stock W.   And that a move in stock W will cause a reaction in stock X which will then impact Z.  The time for Z to be impacted might be days or months.  The key is that an action to ""A"" results in a future predictable action in Z.  

For example, Apple says phone sales are slowing.  This impacts the phone component suppliers which impacts the company that makes packaging materials for the components.     When ""A"" occurs it may take time for  Y and even more for Z to be impacted.   Therefore, a move in ""A"" starts a multi step process that takes time to resolve therefore allowing investors to buy/sell Z.   However, if you know the chain exists, then you can predict the future of Z to some degree of probability based on publicly available information and act on that information.

cpktlb,A comprehensive analysis on Spirit Airlines ($SAVE),"In 2017, a Reuters poll showed that U.S flyers preferred cheap tickets over perks and comfort when traveling. Spirit Airlines is a small, but steadily growing ultra-low-cost airline that capitalized early on this trend by introducing ""bare fares"" and ""no frill"" flights, offering relatively cheap base rates for tickets, but charging extra for almost everything else, from choosing seats to bottles of water, essentially unbundling the services that a traditional airline would have included in the price of a normal ticket. Today, we are going to analyze the airline industry, as well as Spirit's operating efficiency, growth, risks, and valuation to ultimately decide whether or not it makes sense to be a shareholder of the underdog airline. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and statistics presented below are as of August 7th, 2019.

###The airline industry

Until recently, airlines were notoriously unprofitable businesses. Fierce competition led to aggressive price cutting, with many airlines losing money on each flight, resulting in massive losses industry-wide. Between 1977 to 2009, the sector suffered combined losses of over $52 billion. However, recent bankruptcies and mergers consolidated the industry, leading to increases in capacity, operating efficiency and overall profitability. In fact, Warren Buffett, who had once called airlines ""a death trap for investors"", now owns a stake in all of the big four U.S airlines: American, United, Delta and Southwest. The big four currently dominate the U.S domestic airline industry, with almost 70% combined market share.

In spite of its history, 2018 marked the 10th consecutive year of profitability for U.S airline industry. Capacity has grown at an average rate of 2.5% each year since 2009, and major U.S airlines carry over 17% more passengers than they did 10 years ago. The industry is expected to continue growing, with the U.S Federal Aviation Administration forecasting a 1.9% average annual growth in passengers over the next two decades.

Operating efficiency is key in the airline business. Airlines run at relatively low margins, so modest increases in unit revenues or decreases in unit costs can tremendously affect overall profitability. For example, the expenses of scheduled flights do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried. Whether a flight is at full capacity or half capacity, the airline will incur similar labor, fuel and other costs. Therefore, on the revenue side, a slight increase in load factor (the percentage of aircraft seats actually occupied on a flight) may significantly improve the overall profitability of a flight. Similarly, on the cost side, a slight percentage increase in fuel costs could have a materially negative effect on an airline's operating profits.

Labor and fuel costs disproportionately represent overall airline expenses. In 2018, labor and fuel represented approximately 24% and 32% of Spirit's operating expenses respectively. Therefore, an airline's operating efficiency depends highly on its ability to bargain effectively with its labor unions, as well as the pricing and availability of aircraft fuel. Some airlines manage fuel price volatility risk through derivative contracts. Others choose to pay market rates over long periods of time as a form of natural hedging, letting the occasional high price average out the occasional low price.

###Operating Efficiency

As one would expect, Spirit has relatively low unit revenues, given their cheap ticket prices. However, Spirit also has the lowest unit costs in the United States, and therefore has the advantage of being able to maintain profitability at low prices where its competitors cannot.

Spirit maintains another competitive advantage by operating a single-fleet type of Airbus A320-family aircraft that is one of the youngest and most fuel efficient in the United States operated by common flight crews. By operating a single aircraft type, Spirit is able to avoid the costs of training crews across multiple types while also making flight crews interchangeable across all aircraft. Additionally, the average age of an aircraft in Spirit's fleet is only 5.4 years, allowing for comparatively low maintenance costs. However, it is expected that these costs will increase as the fleet ages.

In terms of performance, Spirit has been steadily improving. In 2015, Spirit ranked last among all U.S airlines in on-time arrivals. However, following a management change the following year, Spirit climbed its way to first place in on-time performance in 2018, while continuing to maintain its low costs. Additionally, Spirit's cancellation rate improved from 6% in May 2017 to only 0.56% in the same month the following year.

###Growth

Although Spirit has been around since the 1960s, it only transitioned into its current business model of ultra-low-cost-carrier in 2007. As a pioneer in the ultra-low-cost-carrier space, Spirit's brand reputation has taken a beating over the years for being perceived as excessively stingy (customers were surprised about having to pay for a bottle of water), as well as their poor on-time performance and cancellation rates. However, Spirit's brand has seen steady improvement over recent years as customers became more understanding of their business model, and as late/cancellation rates declined due to operating efficiency improvements. As a result, Spirit has more than doubled its share of the U.S domestic market to 4% in the past six years. It has grown its revenues by 72% over the past five years, and plans to continue growing its capacity in the mid-teens over the next several years. Spirit's ability to grow its earnings will depend mostly on whether or not it can execute on its capacity growth plans and minimize cancellations, while continuing to manage and reduce costs. Over the next few decades, they may see gains from macroeconomic tailwinds, as the air travel market is expected to grow steadily. Additionally, low-cost-carriers have been consistently growing their share of the total air travel market, and if this trend continues, Spirit would be well-positioned to benefit.

###Risks

Spirit is susceptible to many of the same risks as other airlines, including disruptions or cancellations from unexpected weather problems and other factors beyond Spirit's control, rising oil prices and other variable costs, as well as other macroeconomic issues such as economic downturns. However, most of these issues are short-term in nature, and don't pose existential threats to the business. The greatest threat to Spirit's business is increased competition from traditional carriers. Beginning 2015, domestic carriers with far more resources than Spirit began to match lower cost airline pricing in order to compete with Spirit and other low-cost airlines. So far, Spirit has been able to hold its ground, continuing to grow its revenues and market share. However, it is uncertain whether or not Spirit can maintain its rate of growth in such a competitive environment.

Additionally, Spirit's assets are almost 70% funded by debt, due to the large upfront costs of purchasing aircrafts. This could put Spirit in a bad position in the event of an economic downturn. However, this is somewhat offset by Spirit's strong cash position of $1.22 billion compared to its current liabilities of $1.21 billion, resulting in a cash-ratio of 1.01, which is relatively high compared to other airlines. Over the past several years, Spirit has continued to maintain a strong cash position relative to short-term debt, demonstrating their intention to be prepared in the event of an economic downturn.

###Valuation

The following discounted future earnings model makes the following assumptions: Spirit's earnings will grow at 5% year over year for five years starting July 2019; it will have a price/earnings ratio of 11 at the end of this period; and the investor demands an 11% annualized return during this period. Discounting future earnings under these assumptions, Spirit's present value is approximately $3 billion. Its current market capitalization is about $2.8 billion, meaning that the stock is currently undervalued under these assumptions. However, any model is only as good as its inputs, and even a small change in expected earnings growth, terminal price/earnings ratio or discount rate could have a significant impact on the present value. Whether or not you should to invest in Spirit at these prices will depend on your own expected future value and required rate of return.

###Conclusion

Despite being an underdog in the U.S domestic airline market, Spirit is a company with relatively strong fundamentals and solid growth potential. However, Wall Street does not seem to agree with this sentiment. Spirit's price/earnings ratio of 8 and price/book value of 1.36 seems to imply very low expectations of growth, despite a history of consistent, moderate growth. If Spirit is able to effectively execute on its growth plans, it may prove to be a very profitable investment at today's prices.",r/investing,1565654068.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cpktlb/a_comprehensive_analysis_on_spirit_airlines_save/,u---wot---m8,38,0.85,44,,False,788312,3,False,0,44

U.S. Economy

Fed Considers New Tool for a Downturn
The countercyclical capital buffer would require banks to hold more capital should the economy show signs of overheating

WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve officials are weighing whether to use a tool that could reduce the risk of a credit crunch in a downturn.
The tool is known as the countercyclical capital buffer. It allows the Fed to require banks to hold more loss-absorbing capital should the economy show signs of overheating, or to keep less of it during bad economic times. The buffer applies generally to banks with more than $250 billion in assets, including firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.

The Fed’s board of governors so far hasn’t used the tool, approved in 2016. Its rule on the buffer says it should turn it up when economic risks are “meaningfully above normal” and reduced when they “abate or lessen.”

Now, some Fed officials are debating whether it is time to use the tool, which could provide banks with additional lending firepower in a subsequent downturn. It isn’t clear when they might make a decision.

“The idea of putting it in place so you can cut it, that’s something some other jurisdictions have done, and it’s worth considering,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a late July press conference.

Deciding whether to use the buffer is somewhat fraught, though. Banks are reluctant to hold even more capital than they do today as this could hamper their profitability. That is already under strain due to low interest rates.

Plus, it isn’t clear how markets would interpret such a move by the Fed, especially since this would be a first. Investors could find the buffer reassuring, believing the Fed is giving itself additional room to fight a downturn. Or they could be unsettled by it, fearing the Fed believed a slowdown is imminent.

Fed officials have been debating about whether to use the tool since last year. Now, they are raising another question: how it should be used.
Some officials have suggested turning it on without increasing capital levels—signaling the Fed is prepared to use the tool, even if not right away. Others think higher capital requirements should be applied now.

Either move would give the central bank the option of lowering the requirement during a downturn.

Fed Gov. Lael Brainard, an Obama appointee, favors turning on the buffer now and raising capital requirements for big banks. She dissented from a March Fed vote to leave the buffer dormant.

“Turning on the [buffer] would build an extra layer of resilience and signal restraint, helping to damp the rising vulnerability of the overall system,” she said in a May speech.

Others say capital levels are already high enough, and that the tool could be used instead as a release valve for bad times.

“We rely on through-the-cycle, always on, high capital and liquidity requirements,” Mr. Powell said. “I view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right.”

Randal Quarles, the Fed’s vice chairman for bank supervision, at a July Fed conference in Boston said, “The overall risk to financial stability is swamped by the extremely low leverage in the financial sector. ”

Messrs. Quarles and Powell have cited the Bank of England’s approach as a possible model for the U.S. In the U.K., the countercyclical capital buffer is set at 1% of risk-weighted assets when risks are “neither subdued nor elevated,” allowing the central bank to dial it down if the economy is thrown a curveball.

Banks have argued the buffer shouldn’t be turned on now because they are already subject to regulations, including other capital requirements, that ensure they are prepared for bad times. One example is the Fed’s annual stress tests that banks must pass to prove they would continue lending in a recession.

At the same time, they have encouraged the Fed to reduce other capital requirements. The central bank would likely have to do that if it activated the countercyclical capital buffer while maintaining the same amount of capital in the banking system, as suggested by Messrs. Powell and Quarles.

The countercyclical capital buffer was created in 2010 by international regulators through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It is being used in other parts of the world, including Sweden and Hong Kong.",r/investing,1565629724.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cpfan0/fed_considers_new_tool_for_a_downturn/,coolcomfort123,70,0.92,17,,False,788312,0,False,0,67

The People’s Bank of China is “close” to issuing its own cryptocurrency, according to a senior official.

The bank’s researchers have been working intensively since last year to develop systems, and the cryptocurrency is “close to being out,” Mu Changchun, deputy director of the PBOC’s payments department, said at an event held by China Finance 40 Forum over the weekend in Yichun, Heilongjiang. He didn’t give specifics on the timing.

The remarks signal the PBOC is inching toward formally introducing a digital currency of its own after five years of research. Facebook Inc.’s push to create cryptocurrency Libra has caused concerns among global central banks, including the PBOC, which said the digital asset must be put under central bank oversight to prevent potential foreign exchange risks and protect the authority of monetary policy.",r/investing,1565621160.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cpdbuk/chinas_pboc_says_its_own_cryptocurrency_is_close/,coolcomfort123,67,0.87,46,,False,788312,0,False,0,67

cpnzhl,E-Trade Mutual Fund Thoughts,"Hello out there. New poster here and I could use some thoughts based in your prior experience.  There’s quite a few questions here so thanks in advance for addressing any where you may have some wisdom. 

First some background. I’ve been looking into the various platforms to invest in mutual funds. I’m open to ideas and came across etrade and I’m considering investing in aggressive growth mutual funds. I’ve got around $1,000 per month to invest (500 per paycheck). At 40 I’m definitely late to the retirement game but I’m fortunate enough to be in a position where at 53 when I “retire” from my current position I’ll have guaranteed pension of at least $80k per year for life (+ SS in my 60’s); that’s based on my current salary so it’ll probably be higher.  I’m looking at this investment plan to supplement that income.  Of course I intend to work a little but, PT, and be selective.  My only debt is a car payment and some CC debt which is paid in full every month. 

Therefore, I can invest the aforementioned $1k per month. The question is:  How do I do this? I assume I just open the account, set the money to auto deposit, pick the mutual fund, and be done. Is it that simple? I would ideally pick from one of the few thousand no fee funds they have. When I deposit the next amount of money does it to that prior picked fund or do I have to “buy” each time?  My plan would be to select the funds that are deemed most aggressive. I was thinking maybe three or four, does that make sense? Do I incur a fee with every deposit?  Maybe etrade isn’t the best option?  Since I’m asking so many questions would you recommend a robo investing platform for something like this instead?  If so, which one? 

I have a professional six figure job that requires an advanced business type degree but clueless on these issues.  As Denzel said in Philadelphia, explain this to me like I’m a two year old ok because there’s an element to this thing I just can not get through my thick head.",r/investing,1565670071.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cpnzhl/etrade_mutual_fund_thoughts/,newinvest236376,1,0.67,15,,False,788312,0,False,0,1

coz3u7,"""Strike it big stocks for the next decade"", a serious approach.","Yesterday there was a big thread about this, but very few of the answers actually tried to answer the question seriously.

I believe there are three ways companies strike it big:

1) **They invent (or seriously flesh out) and market a new technology**. Think Edison's light bulb. This is the most risky type of investments. Most inventions turn out to be either impossible to create at the time (Theranos, HDSN - if we talk publicly traded), impractical to produce at scale (many ""in 5 years"" technologies that you see in the media) or fail to find consumers (did you know Sears had an online service that offered social media, search engine and an online shop in the late 80s?). Even those that actually scale those three obstacles may not really strike it big and become a niche product (Segway). So extremely risky. The sectore with where most of the invention of new technologies is going on is pharmacology, biotech and material sciences. 

2) **They bring a niche or luxury product/service to the masses**. Think Ford's cars. This is a bit less risky as we are not talking about a possible Theranos/HDSN style failure. It may still fail to scale the production or reach a market though. I think currently there are a lot of ventures that are bringing processes that used to be the domain of big companies to tiny companies. Think Salesforce, Square or Shopify. 

3) **Make an existing service/product much more efficient than any of the competitors**. Think Walmart or South West Airlines. This is even less risky than the previous two - the product or service exists, and is highly marketable, you ""only"" have to be able to implement your more efficient strategy. A lot of the cloud-using companies are like this because they can scale their customers much more easily - Zoom Video for instance, MongoDB, Okta etc.

So here's the deal, I'm going to play with open cards and post a portfolio that will strike it big in the next decade. Laugh at me if you want to, but better yet, give it five years and laugh at me then:

New Tech stock:

GH, FLXN, VRTX, OMER, PCRX, HXL, FMC - extremely risky, expect these to go belly up

Luxury for the masses and/or more efficient than competitors (it's a bit arguable):

MELI, MSFT, AMZN, SHOP, CRM, SQ, AYX, PYPL, TTD, ZM, MDB, OKTA, ZS, TWLO (MSFT and AMZN are here because they provide the cloud for the rest of them) - very risky - I don't think they go bankrupt as easily, but pricing is high and they may not turn out to be the winners the market is expecting them to be. 

Needless to say - I own most of these.",r/investing,1565542265.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/coz3u7/strike_it_big_stocks_for_the_next_decade_a/,stenlis,668,0.93,246,,False,788312,0,False,0,673

cpmxn4,Thoughts about Etoro for long term stocks investing,"Hi, I have recently started using Etoro to invest in stocks/ETFs because I feel that their spreads are much cheaper than the commissions charged by traditional brokers (like banks) and their stocks pay 'dividends' (in the form of a refund).

cpg0cw,Black Swan Investing in Practice,"I recently read ""The Black Swan"" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, and I think he had some interesting points. For those of you who have not read his work, essentially his argument is that events that should be low-frequency end up occurring a lot more frequently than one might expect; while we are unable to predict what these events will be, it is possible to profit off of them by allocating money into a wide variety of investments that pay off with ""low-probability."" His argument rests on the assumption that the market fails to account for the relatively high frequency of events that should be rarer.

Even if you accept these assumptions, though, I was wondering how one might in practice actually incorporate this theory into a viable investing strategy? I know that I might be verging on trading territory here, but how would one even begin to value and allocate funds into a Black Swan-inspired strategy? I've done some reading, and it seems like Taleb has been associated with funds that attempt to do this by purchasing OTM puts with expiration dates far into the future; however, even if the market were to dip, how would one know when to sell these puts?

I guess I am confused about how Black Swan strategies actually work in the real world and how they essentially differ from ""buy low, sell high?"" I'd love it if anybody could offer some feedback or insight.

cpg5r5,Wife cashed her IRA way too early,"Hello and thanks for any advice. So in 2016 unbeknownst to me my wife cashed part of a regular IRA that she had rolled over from a previous employers 401k. 

Last week we received a letter from the IRS since we file jointly. The IRS found a discrepancy in her reported income that was reported as retirement income from the IRA. 

She paid the 10% penalty when she withdrew but did not know to disclose this as income. She thought the 10% was the tax on the income. 

So now we have to pay back taxes on that extra income.

Does anyone know about the 60 day transfer from IRA to another IRA?  Since she did put some of that money into a separate IRA but didn’t tell me about that. 

Is there anyway to reduce the amount by what she put into the other IRA?

SWN is currently trading at an awkward PE just above 1.

On paper that sounds great, your investment will double in value every year! But actually it’s usually a sign of something wrong.

The stock price has fallen from $5 to $1.80 in the past year, but they are still making money and paying off debt. They are making progress towards getting out of hole they are in.

Is the PE evaluation of 1 simply because the market has no confidence in their ability to succeed long term, or am I missing something else important here? Any veterans want to take a look and help me find my errors?

I am currently 21 years old, and have my own freight logistics business and am currently netting anywhere from 8,000-15,000 a month depending on the market, currently market is at a low due to all the tarrifs etc; but hopefully the market should be picking back up soon. 

On a side note I have roughly 80,000 dollars saved up in my bank account, I don't have that many payments to make a month besides my car, I still live with my parents and don't go to school anymore; I also currently have ZERO debt.

Last but not least, I also make alternative rock/ underground rap music as a side hobby/passion and make a few hundred bucks a month off of it but am slowly getting more exposure and more noticed and that's something that I also want to pursue further.

&#x200B;

**My Main Question:**

**The only thing that I do all day during the weekdays is run my business and work for roughly 10-12 hours a day, on the weekends I am free. I am trying to find something else that I can potentially invest my time and or money into to make a side income or a side business of some sort, because I find myself having a lot of free time after hours from work and especially on the weekends.**

**Whether it be investing in stocks, or some other sort of investments I can also be making with my money, I would appreciate some tips on that end as well. I am willing to use some of the disposable amount of money I have saved up to pursue this because I'd rather be putting it into something then letting it sit in my account collecting little to no interest at all.**

I have said it three times in a row because it is true!

Many of my friends at the investment club I belong to have been saying ""this time is different"" during the latest stock market correction.

Most of us are in our 50s and 60s and have been following the stock market since the 1970s and been seen it all.  But they are saying this feels so very different. They had never seen a President like Trump, a Congress, and Federal Bureaucracy so obedient to a President.  They have never seen a trade war that has so much potential to cause major damage.  They are scared and are thinking about going to cash (CD's) until this all settles out.

I ask them how we will know when to go back into the stock market.  They really don't have an answer.

Many are a few years from retirement and have a minimum investment value before that can feel they are financially independent.  If they lose 30% or more in their balanced portfolio, all bets are off regarding retirement until they get their money back, which may take over ten years. At least a CD interest rate of 3% will stabilize their assets until things settle down.  Then when the time is right we can go back into the stock market.

I've noticed many private investors invest in very big companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, etc.. I can't really figure out why this is so popular. Why would a private investor with way less capital than investment firms, invest like investment firms?

Like Buffett said in 1999:  “*If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I’d be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.*” 

If Warren Buffett was running $1 million today, I doubt that he would invest in the biggest companies on the planet. I think he would try to find companies that are undervalued and fits his criteria in small/mid-cap companies that the public doesn't know much about.

There are tons of people online selling programs on teaching people how to trade stocks. I dont trust any of them, as I dont think I should. They all have the same exact personality and sleezy characteristics.

Even in simple interviews of investors, from experienced to novice 25-year-old millionaires. They all beat around the bush when asked a simple question. ""How did you learn to invest?"" ""How much money do you trade in a day?"" etc... then they will spend 20 minutes talking about bullshit that had nothing to so with the question.

Theres never a definite answer on how to invest, which is what makes it so difficult to try and learn about it. The only advice I get is literally ""you just have to do it"". What?? You cant even give me a guideline? Maybe tell me to follow a stock and buy it when it goes down in a pattern?? It make me believe there is no way to be successful trading stocks. Nobody ever has a definite answer or at least a guideline to anything.

cp5jw6,Depression comparison,"I was posting on twitter about the looming arrival, or already landed, recession in the United States.  I was looking at the gold prices rising, bond yields dropping and rising stock market volatility.  I posted that it's the same statistical movements as the 2008 recession just without the housing bubble and somebody replied, that's worse, meaning that it would be a worse recession without the housing bubble.

I've been reading through Ben Bernanke's book and he basically outlined that because the recession looked like a housing bubble crash in the beginning the fed was hesitant to make market movements because strategies for the housing industry would have negative effects on the otherwise strong economy.  I would then be led to believe that the recession would be less damaging without a housing bubble.

coxbif,Thoughts on Blackline? ($BL),"Blackline is an accounting software company that provides SaaS solutions to *automate complex, manual and repetitive accounting processes.*

They IPO'd in 2016, and currently have a market cap of \~$2.87B.

Interesting stats:

* High inside ownership, with CEO Therese Tucker currently holding shareholding of about 13% in a company
* High Net Promotor Score of 79 compared to an industry average of 40
* Revenue up 26% year over year
* Customer growth up 17% year over year

I find this stock particularly interesting as they're applying automation to boring repetitive work. Their CEO Therese Tucker has a strong technical background, with a background in Software Engineering and Computer Science rather than a typical business background.

It reminds me a lot of a Peter Lynch stock especially given the somewhat boring Accounting industry. 

>*“The perfect stock would be attached to the perfect company, and the perfect company has to be engaged in a perfectly simple business, and the perfectly simple business ought to have a perfectly boring name.” — Peter Lynch*

BlackLine went public less than three years ago, and since then, its quarterly revenue has more than doubled.

On it's recent earnings call the management team mentioned that it's addressable market for its products is about $18 billion, so considering that it expects full-year revenue of about $284 million, I think $BL has a lot of room to grow.

**I think this stock is really interesting for an investor with a long term investing horizon.** I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts as to why or why not this is a good buy.

cowzl5,Lithium market flood and Panasonic stocks & strategy,"TLDR: Do you consider Panasonic a good stock to buy?

I am setting up my portfolio and am looking into the exposure to the Electric Vehicle, Battery and Energy markets. I was looking into some stocks and put these pieces together. Please tell me if it sounds farfetched.

My rationale: Panasonic produces batteries in partnership with Tesla, signed an agreement with Toyota to produce EV batteries starting 2020 and the stock is down to 2016 levels. Lithium is predicted to flood the Market coming from China, Australia and Latin America, cutting the price of the raw material considerably (\~50%). Panasonic - being a major consumer of Lithium for its production - expects a major increase in output (Toyota partnership and Teslas' Gigafactory expansion) and a drop in raw material cost. Also, Panasonic produces competitively-priced solar panels, which may see an increase in demand due to the energy requirements of EVs (shifting from gas to electricity) which shows no sign of slowing down.

So, I am inclined to buying some Panasonic stocks while still expecting some initial downturn (as to not try and time the market).

coppm4,Are 'share-leavers' (buybacks participators) the only ones that get any value if the company only ever does buybacks?,"I happen to go in circles when I think of buybacks as opposed to dividends, so I'm leaving my thoughts here, maybe I fail to see something crucial.

So, buybacks. Companies love them, so much so  that they also apparently do it on credit at the moment and might possibly be one of the sources of a future crises (or something, this just happens a lot on r/investing).  And I get the mechanism, mostly, in a shorter run: companies buy some stock  back on the open exchange, prices rise, lower tax rates on buybacks as opposed to dividends, ratios like EPS go up, investors ('share-leavers') that did decide to sell their stock to the company get some nice lump sum payment. Okay, that's fine and easy to get.

What makes me go in a loop is a same process on a longer timespan:  if I were to make a private company, never to release it on an exchange, I would probably like to find a combination of activities that is going to maximize the discounted profits directly available to me (owner). Otherwise, why bother (from the money perspective, I get that there are egos and ideals or whatever) with doing the business and going through all the hassle if the company just grows for a long time, producing and selling more and more goods and services, and then said company just dies because some new company either does the same stuff more efficiently or just renders the older industry obsolete, thus starting the cycle anew (looking by how many companies in an index stay there for, say 20 years)?

Similarly, if I have a stock of an individual company for a long time, that does for first 90% of the lifecycle have amazing earnings and profits per share, that goes ahead and does lots of buybacks for (some) investors and one day begins to make mistakes in the bitter end just going bankrupt at some point, THEN I (a 'loyal' shareholder) am left with nothing (no direct cash received, and the stock is worth zero).

On the other hand, if I do decide to actively participate as a partner with the company in the buybacks procedure in the end of the day it is not that much different than trying to outsmart any other participant on the exchange that also tries to buy your stock with cash (only difference being that cash is from the income of the company itself and the purchase will boost some stats and thus maybe the bump in a price will be more intense). Then, with the proceeds, you either try to buy the same amount of stock for lower price later like your intraday trader or just cash out completely on said investment and buy a yacht/Lambo/self-esteem, but end up with smaller share of a business that is, at some point, going to run out.

I guess the TL;DR question is: why bother trying to invest (in, importantly, lazy,  set-it-and-forget-it way) in  individual companies that constantly grow their business that apparently won't ever try to mature and start paying the shareholders (as opposed to 'share-leavers' through buybacks) more directly with their earned money (like Amazon or, to a surprising extend, Berkshire), if you can just as well buy companies with similar stats that do pay their shareholders with dividends and demise of most any  individual company in a sufficiently long period of time is pretty much guaranteed?",r/investing,1565481762.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/coppm4/are_shareleavers_buybacks_participators_the_only/,qamtam,10,0.76,35,,False,788312,0,False,0,9

coignm,Building a model forecasting gold prices,"Hello, I've been trying to build a model (linear regression) to forecast short-term gold price movements.  My model is based on this website: [https://goldenopportunitiesforinvestors.wordpress.com/gold-price-regression-model/](https://goldenopportunitiesforinvestors.wordpress.com/gold-price-regression-model/) and this website: [https://www.gold-eagle.com/article/gold-prices-%E2%80%93-next-5-years](https://www.gold-eagle.com/article/gold-prices-%E2%80%93-next-5-years).

Basically, the variables used are US Dollar Index, Money supply (1/3 US, 1/3 Europe in USD, 1/3 Japan in USD), real interest rate (trailing 12 month CPI - FED 6m rate).  I used the 6m rate because the 1yr rate didn't have enough data (don't worry the 6m is annualized).  Finally, I used the Economic Uncertainty Index as a variable and the spread between long-term treasuries and junk bonds (representing financial uncertainty).  I also added momentum variables.

cocdtk,(biopharma news) $GILD. Biktarvy has been approved for treatment of HIV in China.,"This single tablet regimen is a blockbuster in developed nations that are already saturated with an overabundance of treatment options for HIV-1. There are other effective regimens available, even as a single tablet option, however Biktarvy has been a preferred choice for both 1) new diagnoses and 2) existing cases that are able to transition to a single tablet regimen. 

This is a big deal for GILD. If you read my first link, you'll find that in recent years, China has had a significant increase in new diagnoses of HIV. If you didn't already know, when people are recently infected, they are most contagious/infectious within the first 30-40 days.

con1d1,"If one believes a recession is imminent, how should they behave in regards to their investments?","Hoping to generate some good discussion here.

For example, given the follow beliefs:

-	A recession will start within the next two years
-	The total market will grow less than 10% over the next two years (pre-recession)
-	The recessionary drop will result in losses of 30% or more
-	The market will eventually recover

Side note: which of these are the most and least likely in your opinion?

What should one do? It seems like, to me, pulling cash out of investments now would be reasonable and then reinvesting once the recession hits could result in some great gains. Obviously it’s hard to know where the bottom is, but let’s say once everything is down ~20%, you could invest the cash monthly (over the course of another two years, say).

co4m2l,"Why BND/Total Bond Funds aren't as ""safe"" as r/Investing may suggest","My gloomy market outlook has me in a large allocation of bond funds/cash which I feel many investors fail to see the complexity of.

BND/VBTLX, Vanguard's total bond market fund, is highly recommended and I see it in many portfolios. This is in place of what I believe to be superior Intermediate or Long term Treasury funds. I don't think this is a wise choice in our current market and future markets. Factors are the historically low gap between investment and junk bond yields, extremely high overall levels of corporate debt, the usage of said debt in share buyback vs. investment, and the dovish Fed and international banks driving negative yields. Also I think the ratings agencies and industry are making similar mistakes as in 2008 but that's more of a ""hot take"".

I have my doubts about the value of the 36% Corporate bond allocation in BND. Specifically due to the 17.5% allocation to Baa/BBB which is the minimum rating before being labeled non-investment aka Junk bonds. I'd advise you research yourself, but a good start is [this January opinion piece](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/60798C96-1297-11E9-BDC3-ED774D018C33). A key takeaway is: ""... according to Morgan Stanley, the U.S. has been flooded with BBB-rated bonds. In the past 10 years, the triple-B bond market has exploded from $686 billion to $2.5 trillion, an all-time high. In other words, 50% of the investment-grade bond market now sits on the lowest rung of the investment-grade ladder.""

This is a story we've heard too often. Bond issuers choose who gets to rate their bonds and pay them for the service. There is incredible incentive to keep new issues at or above Baa/BBB because they qualify for investment grade bond funds and indexes. In addition we label lesser ratings as ""Junk"" so a company losing rating literally ""goes to Junk"" as a news headline. Any future issues are ""Company issues 50MM in Junk"". If you have faith in the credit rating agencies you still have to look at your return for choosing these near-junk bonds vs. US treasuries.

* VBTLX aka BND (6yr avg duration) yielded a 3mo average 2.84% with 2.77% last month. 
* VFITX (5.3yr avg duration treasuries only) yielded a 3mo average 2.59% with 2.28% last month. 
* VUSTX (17.4yr avg duration treasuries only) yielded a 3mo average 2.75% with 2.58% last month.

A direct comparison between intermediate funds shows an increasing gap currently at .49%. For the risk of adding 36% corporate bonds (half are almost junk) this premium seems way too low. [A 2008 law showed Baa/BBB defaulting in average between 4.5% by Moody's and 10% by S&P](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating#Investment_grade). Actual default rates fluctuate with economic cycles. But you're taking a lot of default and credit risk for that extra .49% (~$5/yr per $1,000) when corporate debt is at all time highs due to basement level rates.

If you do choose to remove the corporate bonds your principal is now subject to full exposure to treasury interest rate changes. In the current environment of dropping rates, a dovish Fed, negative international rates, and a looming downturn I see this as a benefit for capital appreciation. 

Bond values move opposite 1% per year of duration for every 1% move in rates. Specific example: if the rate dropped from 1.75% to 1% on a 30yr treasury. Existing bonds with 10yrs to mature would appreciate by 10x.75 or 7.5%. If your bond had 20 years you'd appreciate 15%. If that rate then rises .25% you would depreciate 2.5% vs 5%. In plain talk the long term vanguard funds is three times as vulnerable to rate changes vs the intermediate fund. 

It's up to you to decide if you want to concentrate instead of diversify your bond holdings. For the conservative outlook, buy and hold investor I'd suggest moving into a medium term treasury fund until corporate debt crashes or starts to pay a higher premium. If you want to keep that defensive equities exposure then take some of the 17%-34% that was in corporate bonds and invest into value/dividend focused funds like VIG/NOBL. 

Personally I'm headed to a 50/50 split of my bond portfolio between medium and long term treasuries. #beargang 🐻🐻🐻",r/investing,1565367524.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/co4m2l/why_bndtotal_bond_funds_arent_as_safe_as/,gunsforfun,34,0.81,37,,False,788312,0,False,0,29

cojgzc,Why JCPenney is a sell (JCP),"    To quote Bob Dylan, “the times are a changin.” With that exists in JCPenney (JCP).  A department store that has been around for decades, 864 stores exist that bears the name, a name that, unlike WalMart, has not changed with the consumer business.  Why?  Let us find out.

    JCPenney lost $717 million in 2014, whilst losing $255 million in 2018.  Over the past five years, JCPenney has lost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Akin to Shopko and Woolworth’s, JCPenney has failed due to two reasons.  First, their inability to change.  WalMart changed by allowing deliver at both their store and at the customers store.  JCPenney did not.  Secondly, the rise of the internet.  JCPenney sells their products at a higher rate online than Amazon, which is cost efficient.  

    The department store company has about $1 billion in book value; but, their debt is over $4.02 billion; and, their equity is $278 million.  Akin to Donald Trump in the early 1990’s, JCPenney is overwhelmed with debt. If the company had money and consistent earnings, the company would have no problems paying off the debt; but, when the company has lost money over so many years, it is impossible to restructure debt unless one declares bankruptcy. The company, as of July 19th, 2019, collapsed sixteen percent in stock price.  

    Those who have seen Sears will know that, while a company may be hot for a while, the inability to change will lead to stock collapse.

cutfyy,/r/Politics is celebrating 3 years of the AMA program and over 300 successful AMAs!,"Happy AMA day, everyone! Three years ago today on August 24th 2016, we kickstarted the official /r/Politics Ask Me Anything program with a [very... special... AMA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4zd07t/my_writing_in_the_huffington_post_salon_and_the/)

&#x200B;

A few AMAs had ever occurred on /r/politics before that (13 of them in about 4.5 years), but it was in August 2016 that we decided to make a concerted effort to build a thriving AMA program in this community. I'd say that we've been wildly successful! On June 11th we hosted the 300th official event of the AMA series, [a Q&A with Jonathan Capehart, an editorial board member of The Washington Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bzf4s5/im_jonathan_capehart_columnist_and_editorial/).

&#x200B;

Every single one of those [300+ AMAs can be viewed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/ama), along with the bonus 13 from before the program actually started. There's a lot to peruse! We've hosted [senators](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bwpqqi/we_are_us_senator_ron_wyden_and_reddit_ceo_steve/), [governors](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c66qxi/im_john_hickenlooper_a_geologist_turned_brewer/), [cartoonists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/atlfb8/im_a_political_cartoonist_turned_political/), [leftists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8ux46x/we_are_organizers_from_the_occupyicepdx_movement/) and [rightists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5rvt51/im_roger_stone_political_insider_and_longtime/?ref=search_posts), [lawyers](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c8ciwp/im_amy_howe_supreme_court_reporter_for_howe_on/), [mayors](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6dbfr3/hello_im_mike_rawlings_mayor_of_dallas_home_of/?sort=qa), some [communists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6evqkk/our_names_are_chauncey_robinson_joe_sims_and/?utm_term=53d9c821-efe5-4947-8793-cf0d29357e91&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=politics&utm_content=1), some [anti-communists](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/66caxl/ama_with_ben_shapiro_the_daily_wires_ben_shapiro/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit), and a whole lot more. We have built wonderful lasting relationships with organizations such as [Advance Local](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8a21wu/im_connor_sheets_the_alcom_reporter_whos_been/?sort=qa), [the ACLU](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bmmiix/were_aclu_voting_rights_and_mass_incarceration/), and [The Washington Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6di3em/im_david_fahrenthold_washington_post_reporter_who/).

&#x200B;

We have come a really long way in these three years, and we're so proud of what we've built with all your help. The AMA program is a labor of love that takes a long time. I reach out to folks that I or other mods think of, or [you suggest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPb-2CtL2lIsMo9xOvs6sdQGDymyZ29seWyQsNTJy1oxPthw/viewform?usp=sf_link) (did you know I've contacted over 750 people and organizations about AMAs?), as well as have them reach out to us, or be referred to us by /u/Chtorrr and our other friends on the Reddit admin team. I send several emails every single day, and even make the occasional phone call to organize AMAs and educate their hosts. [Our calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=rpoliticsmods@gmail.com) is meticulously updated, the AMA list kept fresh, and flairs are handed out to every verified submitter. Lately we've begun using [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/rSlashPolitics) to keep you in the loop, because nobody should ever miss an AMA they're excited about.

&#x200B;

We want to take this post to celebrate, to thank all our wonderful guests for their time, to thank you, the participants for asking so many thoughtful questions, to reminisce about the times we've had, and to brainstorm together about where we'd like to go in the future.

&#x200B;

Let me know what your favorite AMA has been, and let me know who you'd like to see in the time to come. Let me know what you like as-is, and what you'd like to see tweaked.

&#x200B;

cw5cq9,"My name's Dale Beran I used to make webcomics, now I write on 4chan, 8chan, and how those places spawned the alt-right AMA.","I just wrote [a book](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250189745) about the history of 4chan and 8chan and how those places became epicenters for the alt-right, incels, and mass shooters. Somehow I went from creating webcomics online (I used to make one called A Lesson is Learned) to tracking online extremism, but I guess, well, so did a lot of the internet.  In light of recent events, I thought it might be helpful to do an AMA on the topic and share what I learned. Feel free to AMA.

I am European, and currently living in the Netherlands. I have recently started getting into investing and for part of my portfolio I use Degiro.

A question that I have not been able to clearly answer for myself is the one in the title. Let me give a clear example.

I would like to buy some AT&T(T) stocks, whose stock trades in NYSE. However there are other stock exchanges that seem to trade AT&T, such as XETRA, where the stock is named ""SOBA"" and each stock's price is a bit lower, the return trend of the stock over the years is not exactly the same, but still extremely similar, and the dividend is similar but still not exactly the same.

Could someone who is knowledgeable on the subject explain how this works, and most importantly whether for me as a European it is preferable to buy the EU version or the US one, taking into account the exchange to USD/Euro as well?",r/investing,1566995110.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cwk31d/is_there_a_difference_between_original_us_stocks/,opalampo,1,1.0,0,,False,788377,0,False,0,1

I am European, and currently living in the Netherlands. I have recently started getting into investing and for part of my portfolio I use Degiro.

A question that I have not been able to clearly answer for myself is the one in the title. Let me give a clear example.

I would like to buy some AT&T(T) stocks, whose stock trades in NYSE. However there are other stock exchanges that seem to trade AT&T, such as XETRA, where the stock is named ""SOBA"" and each stock's price is a bit lower, the return trend of the stock over the years is not exactly the same, but still extremely similar, and the dividend is similar but still not exactly the same.

Could someone who is knowledgeable on the subject explain how this works, and most importantly whether for me as a European it is preferable to buy the EU version or the US one, taking into account the exchange to USD/Euro as well?",r/investing,1566996637.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cwkdcd/is_there_a_difference_between_original_us_stocks/,opalampo,1,1.0,1,,False,788382,0,False,0,1

cwktoa,"Yuan continues to fall.. Longest Drop Since 2015, lowest since 2009","1. Every time we raise tariffs on China, Chinese Yuan devalues making their exports cheaper, hence cancelling the effect. At the same time US exports are double tariffed - from the currency devaluation and tariff added by China.  


2. All of US exports to China are tariffed but only half of Chinese exports to US have a tariff. So the other half of Chinese product is becoming more competitive, their companies can more profit on them.  


3. In 2015 USD Yuan was at 6.20, today it is around 7.19. Yuan wasn't so weak since 2009.  China can fight the trade war for many years but that is decimating US exports. US exports are dropping not just to China but to rest of the world as well. 

4.  As Yuan devalues, so does Euro, Korean Won, Indian Rupee... This makes US exports less competitive around the world vs Chinese/Korean products. Eg. iPhone more expensive in Europe and China, Samsung is cheaper. Makes Boeing more expensive than Airbus.   


5.  Better way to fight China is by isolating them. Together with EU. Human rights is Hong Kong and north China.   Why is Huawei getting repeated exemptions?

 

China is playing this very long, We have so many political considerations and fold easily.. We need to fight smarter.

cwl97p,QUESTION: I have a Roth IRA and I’m not sure if I’m using correctly.,So I’m in my early 20’s. My dad always hounded me about getting a Roth IRA. Over and over. All the time. So I finally opened one a couple months ago. I had heard that “if you start a Roth IRA in your 30’s you’ll be a millionaire by the time you’re 60!” I threw a couple hundreds in at a time with my paychecks until I couldn’t anymore (moved out have to pay for rent etc now). I’m up to $600. I haven’t checked it since like March and it’s still at $600. Exactly. Where. I left it. So my newb question here is: what do I need to do? Do I need to put more money into it? Do I need to actually invest in certain stocks with it? The account says that all my assets are in short term. Any suggestions?,r/investing,1567001047.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cwl97p/question_i_have_a_roth_ira_and_im_not_sure_if_im/,AirJackieQ,1,1.0,0,,False,788403,0,False,0,1

“Conventional wisdom holds that you invest in bonds for yield and equities for capital appreciation,” wrote Credit Suisse analysts, led by chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub, in a note to clients. “While this might be true historically, with 10-Year Treasury yields collapsing (to 1.5% from 3.2%) over the past 9 months, stocks now offer the best of both.”

“That stock yields are higher than bond yields is certainly a strong argument to own U.S. equities,” Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research told Yahoo Finance. “It won’t protect you from near term volatility, but over a long holding period (years) you should do much better in stocks.”

“The worst case scenario is that we get a deep recession and companies have to cut their dividends,” Colas added. “That happened after the financial crisis, when the companies of the S&P 500 cut dividends by an aggregate of 25%. If the same were to happen again now, the real yield on the S&P would be 1.5% - which is still the same as Treasuries.”",r/investing,1567005021.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cwm3yn/stocks_are_the_new_bonds/,coolcomfort123,1,1.0,0,,False,788417,0,False,0,1

cwmfk0,Trade War & Self Fulfilling Prophecy,"[https://terrencenotes.com/2019/08/24/trade-war-self-fulfilling-prophecy/](https://terrencenotes.com/2019/08/24/trade-war-self-fulfilling-prophecy/)

Shortly after the U.S. government postponing some tariff on China’s imported goods in order to appeal to U.S. voters in the upcoming black Friday shopping season, China retaliates with 5-10% tariff on U.S. goods, mainly automobiles and agriculture (largely soybean).

As global markets heading to a temporary trade truce, China’s retaliation comes at an interesting time. The U.S. government did not sit back and think thoroughly and immediately reversed its tariff postponement by further increasing the 25% tariff on US$250bn goods to 30%, effective 1st Oct 2019. In addition, the US$300bn China products were initially taxed at 10% will now go to 15%.

Trade war has escalated to an irreversible phase. Judging at how the U.S. Minister for Commerce and the White House calibration towards China imposed tariff, it is quite clear that U.S. government had miscalculated the trade war game plan. What started as a trade bluff has now become a self-fulfilling prophecy whereas U.S. government is now being forced to continue to talk their story of the evil China making tons of money from them.

While it is true that China has been exporting products and goods to the U.S., it is the U.S. consumers who can’t get rid of the bad habit of borrowing today, pay later mentality, to maintain their standard of livings that caused huge trade imbalance between the U.S. and China.

Furthermore, China has 1.4 billion of population with GDP per capita at around US$10,000 while the U.S. GDP per capita is about 4x more. The invisible hand of a free market mechanism will always direct the manufacturing to the lowest cost production base.

Apple manufactures majority of their products in China not only because of the lower labour cost there, but also the well-established supply chain there. It is impossible for Apple to move its production base out of China overnight.

Just last week, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook had a dinner with the U.S. President, Tim Cook explicitly made a great point that any tariff imposed on U.S. companies products that are Made in China will make U.S. companies less competitive versus their global competitors. In Apple case, Samsung Electronics is set to benefit greatly.

Economics 101 teaches us that trade war will lead to lower consumption and lower price in the long run. It had already been proven more than 100 years ago trade war or trade protectionism will lead to disaster in the long run. Almost all industries thrive after their protection net is taken away by their government. Apparently, the think tank in the White House doesn’t understand this basic economic principle.

With U.S. government bond yields at historical low, and trade war escalation is likely to lead to a self-fulfilled recession prophecy, it is not difficult to see that U.S. economic data is going to deteriorate from here onwards. Trading economies like Singapore and Hong Kong are also going to suffer a low.

No one wins in a trade war. Those who made that decision for whatever rationales behind, are going to make the average working labour suffer tremendously.",r/investing,1567006511.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cwmfk0/trade_war_self_fulfilling_prophecy/,TT3778,0,0.5,0,,False,788425,0,False,0,0
cwm7vn,Question about 5 year market increases,"I know people say disregard recession, invest now and always. 

But looking at the 5 year track for many stocks it seems difficult for me to get into it now.  For example Nvidia was $20 per share 5 years ago. And its $170 now.  Amazon was a $300/ share and now its $1700/ share.  It's obvious the market has grown exponentially well in the last 5 to 10 years.  Even though I only gave 2 examples a lot of the market seems to be at a premium right now.  

So should I buy into stocks like apple, google, amazon, microsoft, now while they are at an all time high and expect them to continue growing. Or should I look for stocks that are coming up now and will be higher in the next 5 years.  A lot of people made wealth by buying into these companies but 5 years ago I could have purchased almost 6 shares of amazon for the price of one today.  So how can I best take advantage of the stocks today in the way people were able to 5 or 10 years ago?",r/investing,1567005510.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cwm7vn/question_about_5_year_market_increases/,lucky5150,0,0.5,2,,False,788425,0,False,0,0

cwna2q,A theoretical question regarding investing during a recession,"So I’ll start by saying I fully understand and believe in the whole time in the market vs timing the markets idea. Secondly I want to reiterate that this is a *purely theoretical question.* I won’t be acting on this advice for my own savings.

Anyways Let’s say you have a magic orb that tells you we are heading for a major recession. One at least one par with 2008. However you have no way of knowing what portion of the economy is going to collapse so you can’t short the market for huge profit. That’s ok though, you’ve made your money. You just want to weather the upcoming storm without losing your nest egg because you’d like to retire in a couple years if possible. However you also don’t just want your investments sitting as cash. You’d like to at least keep up with inflation.

So would do you move your funds and why? Bonds? Gold? Some type of mutual funds?

The reason I ask is not because this describes my situation at all (unfortunately not close to being the case), but because I constantly hear people saying they are moving into *“safer”* investments right now. However nobody seems to be able to justify how their new strategy is *“safer”* and I don’t know if I’m just not understanding something simple or if people are fooling themselves with a false sense of security.


TL;DR

If you knew there was a recession happening tomorrow and you just wanted to keep up with inflation and not lose all of your savings in the next 2-3 years, what would you do?

cwnp6e,"At a Fundamental Level, This is Why a Diversified Portfolio of the Largest Companies is a Wise Investment (my opinion)","There have been a lot of studies regarding investment portfolios and so on but IMO, this is the primary reason why investing in something like an S&P 500 fund (or anything similar) is a wise idea. I think it has more to do with human nature rather than other factors.

1. People build brand loyalty overtime.....and the largest companies often have the highest amount of brand loyalty.
2. People want the best value or quality products.......the companies which are the best at offering this often become the market leader in a specific industry and generally stay there for long time periods.
3. Monopoly/oligopoly economics makes it difficult for new comers to take market share. #1 and #2 creates barriers to entry for new companies.

Overtime, these companies all have extremely profitable and efficient operations which generate surplus cash flows from operating activities. When value destructive activities do occur (accounting fraud, disruption with new technology), it is often not enough to destroy the surplus value being created by the aggregate of all the companies. I also believe that these human nature characteristics applies to all sorts of markets as well. Look at places like youtube and twitch. I'm sure 80% of all the views, likes, subscribers, and revenue goes to the top 20% of content creators. Also this is the reason why the ""rich get richer"" despite efforts of governments to make everything ""more equal"". People simply want the best and when they find the best, they establish loyalty to that company,brand, product etc.

cwndew,Median House Prices Are Dropping?,"I was reading a book about real estate investing where they make it sound like it's perfectly reasonable to expect the value of your home to rise by about 4% per year. I remember an article by Goldman Sachs, though, that said it was a negative 1% or so. So, I checked the data from the Fed. Check this out: 

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=o3wH](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=o3wH)

I downloaded it and set a linear trendline on the data. I had an R-value of .956! That means that this trendline is an amazingly good fit and has some pretty strong predictive power. Inflation is incredibly low right now, but if it were to kick in again, houses look like really poor investments.

Of course, this ignores the tax advantages and possible rental income. Also, the absurd amount of leverage allowed in real estate might mean that a linear return is still a net positive. So, maybe the take-away is really that the government ought to reconsider all those tax shelters in our actual shelters.

Today I received another email from them saying they reduced their rate once again down to 2%. At this point I might be looking at an alternative option and trying to see which is a good one out there. Also do these APY ever go back up?
