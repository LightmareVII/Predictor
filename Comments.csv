I suppose my question relates to the inversion from the 1MO rate and the 30 Year rate. I’m not understanding how the 1 mo bill could be cheaper than the 30 year bond, considering the extreme gap in maturity. Intuitively, having your money tied up for a longer period of time should be a deterrent for investors, and liquidity is usually a positively viewed feature.

It was also my understanding that the longer the maturity, the more sensitivity to changes in interest rate, yet the 30 year bond is still more expensive. Is this because of the expectations of future fed activity?

Okay, first, the nominal interest rate is just inflation plus real interest rate. Your interest rate should be 6.0%. They are not multiplicative. Charging inflation twice makes no sense.

Next, subtracting a Dollar Amount ($) by a Time x Interest Rate does not make sense. In your equation, the interest rate affects *time*, not the balance/value of the actual money being received, which doesn't make sense. Second, in this case, we're assuming *compounding* interest, so the interest rate *is* multiplicative (with 1+ rate to account for the 12,306).

I was wondering when this question would get asked - I personally hold no licenses, nor did I need to. According to the lawyers I saw, both affirmed me that something with the structure of the fund and the documents would let me skirt around that. While it's very beneficial to have them, there are ways around it apparently. (God bless the legal system.)

Minimum subscription is $100k.

I took my laptop around and showed people what I was doing. Either they gave me money or pointed me in the direction of someone who might be interested.

I have to split up orders a lot more. I also have to be wary about volume in the market I was in, which is something that I didn't really concern myself with as often in the early days. It's also stressful now and then, because I still vividly remember losing $15k and thinking I was going to die - so watching a much larger number get worse is occasionally like watching my own murder.

Not very little, actually. Hedge funds are about the least regulated entities that I know of in the US, which makes things nice. I did go see two separate lawyers, as I mentioned earlier, and they took care of things really well. Really most of red tape comes with accounting. Having a good accountant makes things easier, but there's still a lot of crap work to do.

I don't even really respond to it. I've never read those mountains of research and I haven't been investing for multiple decades.

If you can't beat the market, why take the risk of trying to pick individual stocks? The more efficient the market is, the more fairly everything is priced, the harder it is to find pricing discrepancies (opportunities). Generally speaking the more people that are actively investing/picking the quicker these discrepancies are identified and resolved.

At one extreme - everyone actively invests, everyone picks individual stocks. Pricing discrepancies are quickly identified, traded/resolved etc. The market does whatever it does as a whole, but individual ""undervalued and overlooked situations"" don't exist for long.

At the other extreme - noone actively stock picks, everyone only invests in indexes. Undervalued and overlooked situations would be abundant and long lasting. Incentives would get really pretty skewed - individual stock performance would be decoupled from company performance and just linked to total market sentiment.

We're somewhere between the two extremes, IME (anecdotally) it seems we're getting closer to the index end of the spectrum. I'm not sure I'd call it a bubble though...

If a large number of people are passively invested in index funds you have alot of money going into the stocks inside of those index's.

That is alot of funds going into a small number of companies without actually putting a valuation on them. Thats why we are seeing PE ratios as MSFT:26, AMZN:73, GOOG:23, FB:30, when historically an average PE is around 15. The bubble would be these inflated prices in mostly large cap companies that are leading their index's in performance, the bubble would burst if there is a panic causing people to pull out of their index funds, the index funds wouldn't be strategic on what they would sell to cover those withdraws they would largely be pulling out of these companies causing those over performers to drop faster than the index simply because the index funds are selling to cover withdraws and having nothing to do with what the company itself is doing.",phools,42,1567017576.0,cwm3ay

Right I think his point is more that small(er) cap/value stocks may get inadequate attention due to not having heavy index weighting. 

That's supported by the ""multiyear stretch of underperformance by value stocks and, more recently, by small-caps"". But, how long does this continue? If you think this is a trend (movement to passive) and that that trend contributes to underperformance of value/small cap and that the trend will continue/increase - then you have to believe that at some point the trend reverses (or bubble bursts) OR that you can find opportunities with upside greater than than presumed underperformance. Otherwise it's reason to avoid value/small cap.

If the goal is to get exposure to small cap/value before the trend changes then it's not really value investing at that point (not that he says it is) it's just a different kind of market timing. Invest too early, you'll under perform for a long time. Too late, you miss the trend shift.

Let's say there was a fund which you were fairly confident (but couldn't be totally sure) was going to perform better than the index over the next two to three years, how expensive would the fees have to be to put you off? 0.6%? 1%? 1.5%?

There are many, many funds with terrible track records which have exorbitantly high fees, I wonder how they keep going at all. But there are also some with good track records available at 0.75% or less.

I'm not familiar with the US fund market (I'm guessing most readers of this sub are US people), so I'll provide an example from the UK. This fund is one of the most popular amongst retail investors: [http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=F00000MC3M](http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=F00000MC3M) the type of people who manage their own retirement savings as a hobby not a necessity. (Ignore the 4% initial fee, as most platforms that investors use will waive it.) Its performance over five years is twice that of the benchmark. Its fee is 0.65%, but again, may platforms offer it at a discount, costing the investor just 0.5%.

Is this an example of a third option? There's no guarantees the over performance will continue, of course, but there's no guarantees the stock market will keep rising in the face of climate change and other turmoil either; it does, however, seem to be an honest active fund and not just a disguised tracker with high fees.",hu6Bi5To,7,1567017570.0,eydaydw

cwm3ay,eyduw0c,">There are market indexes (which are not actual financial products) and there are funds available that track those indexes. Your link mentions that it tracks ""a benchmark index"" which is... vague. 

I think you're overthinking this, the VFIAX tracks the S&P 500, [the list of those can be found here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies) These are essentially the largest 500 in the US and following this gives us a good idea of how the US economy is doing. 

>Anyway, that proprietary product might be a real pickle to explain where it gets its weightings from, but we don't need to ask that question.

It uses the same weights as the index its tracking, the problem is indexes don't re-balance the weights. So lets say Company A and Company B had the same weight 5 years ago, over those last 5 years Company A is up 400% while Company B is down 50%, since Company A has done so much better their weight in the index will be 8X more than Company B, and any new money going into an index fund will put 8x more of those funds into Company A than in Company B. If this happens enough it could artificially cause Company A to perform better than they should. 

 >So for these funds, the only question is where do the weightings for the major well-known indexes come from?

It's definitely become worse lately and it's hard to discuss anything people can remotely tie to the President even if there's been no policy actions to come out of it.

Aside from that one of the bigger problems is that accurate information can often end up down voted reactively.  Fed threads have become particularly bad about this as a lot of people can't seem to the grok the idea that it's possible for people to actually ignore a lot of the ridiculousness that President is tweeting.

Another thing I've seen come up here that might need to be addressed in a different way is the explosion of yield curve inversion and recession threads.  I know stickies are limited and precious but I think going forward it might help to have one up for a few weeks covering stuff like uncorrelated assets, bonds and maybe the interest rate sensitivity of some assets, as well an approachable article or two on what the yield curve inversion actually signifies and how it historically lines up with prior recessions.

I agree that low-effort, uncivil posts are bad. They should go. So should posts completely unconnected with investing. But high-effort, civil posts with a connection to investing can also be bad; in fact, many of the most problematic discussions arise from such posts. Here's a typical example, which I just made up:

> Historically, China has attempted to insidiously undermine American capitalism and refuses to play by the rules. Read up on ""forced technology transfers,"" for example. The new tariffs may have a negative short-term effect on the economy, but ultimately they're necessary to show that we won't tolerate a trading partner who doesn't respect the principles of open markets.

I think allowing this sort of post is an awful idea. It's civil, high-effort, and it even talks about the impact of the tariffs on the economy. It may be made out of a genuine desire to participate in a conversation. But ultimately, this post should not be on the sub, because **the point of the post is to express an opinion that is totally unrelated to investing**. Namely, the purpose of the post is to state that, as a matter of policy, the US should not trade with China, unless China reforms certain things. That is a political opinion. It has nothing to do with investing.

As a result, in the responses to this post, you will not find investing-related discussion. In the best case, you will find arguments about the US's trade policy. In the worst case, it will degenerate into a political brawl, with at least one side simply shouting its political talking points over and over again.

This kind of post is actually *worse* than the low-effort posts, because those sometimes attract enough downvotes and/or reports that they get hidden or pushed to the bottom, where they don't attract as much unwanted attention.

I understand that the mods do everything they can to create places for “I’m new to investing” questions. The issue is that the main threads devoted to this rarely get the same attention as if someone just created a separate post called “My grandpa died and left me 100,000...”But these posts clutter the page and make me yearn for WSB or r/econmonitor. I don’t want this to be the subreddit for Q&As for people who can’t search investopedia or even this subreddit’s top posts for five minutes.

So, I recommend a more aggressive auto mod for new posts that says something like “This sounds like a investing basics question. Please repost on Monday or contact the mods if this is not an investing basics question. Here is a list of the most popular and common questions threads (1,2,3,4) and here is Investopedia for terms (for example, how does a ROTH work).”

Trying to deny that is a fool's errand.

It's going to be nearly impossible to avoid that discussion entirely. I mean, let's be honest, when the president tweets that the chairman of the federal reserve is an enemy of the people, causing the markets to recoil and lots of people here to lose lots of net worth, it's unrealistic to think they won't talk about it.

But I think there's a difference in low quality posts (as you listed above), and a post that is relatively well researched, links to valid examples from neutral sources, etc.

So, maybe instead of cracking down on political posts, require political posts to have proper citations to back them up? This way you can help at least elevate things beyond the level of mudslinging?

Edit: I am realizing now that MCS was saying they are kinda hard to do. Maybe I am wrong, maybe he is wrong. My thought is that I'd rather do stickies than whatever ""[meta] thread"" we normally have, but that's not an argument I have really fully formed. MCS / the community might disagree.

Oh, come on... if you've studied as much as you say you have, you should immediately recognize this as a slight variation of Intrade or one of the many similar ""markets"".

You should also be able to poke holes in his ideas all day long from just about every angle (basically, I want some of what he's smoking).

2p8pxw,cmufjsj,"You need to understand how bitcoin works a little under the hood to understand this.  You'll need to understand **why** bitcoin works, and how a decentralized crypto currency can exist.  
  
Bitcoin works because every coin has a publicly verifiable address (that also sort of doubles as a math problem), and people who own coins at that address have a 'key'.  If you have the key, you own the coins that are registered to that address.  
  
The coins are registered in something called the 'block chain', which is a fancy word for the ledger that bitcoin uses to track who owns which coins (and is what is shared all over the entire world).  
  
Again, it's cosmic if it's the first time you've encountered it.  I know it was for me, but the more I looked at it, and the more I tried to find a reason it wouldn't work (as all of humanity has been doing for 5 years now) the more I realized that it DOES work, and is as strong of a system as we can get.

If you want to be “specific” like you said, then you shouldn’t either.  They’re not the same thing.  If you’re saying “masturbating” you’re referring to the art of sitting alone in your basement with your fancy mechanical keyboard and jerking it into a sock whilst crying at how much you hate your life and is mom home with the chicken nuggets yet?  Is your reasoning for associating “fucking off” with masturbating because masturbation is a way of fucking yourself?  Let’s get swingers and BDSM people in there, then, too.  Also, telling someone to fuck off or go fuck yourself?  It’s not one or the other, that’s not how insults work.  It’s both.  Fucking off is an insult meaning for someone to go somewhere away from the antagonized party, preferably a place where injury might come to them.  But that’s not what you said.  You said fuck off as in masturbate, which is not true unless you’re okay with calling all sex acts fucking off, which means that your parents, horny teenagers, aging couples trying to reignite the spark would all be “fucking off.”  Which clearly wasn’t what you intended.

  * **Because he's a part of at least two powerful consumer groups.** Doctors (and nurses) are a powerful lobby, who look out for their own. And are still the most respected profession in the US and the world. Then there's the Chinese/Asian consumers angle.

  * **Because the incident's imagery is almost the perfect set of triggers for mass outrage.** The video had a giant corporation ruining the life of someone vital to American society. Check.

I think the question is whether they would have called the cops so quickly. It seems like they offered people in the airplane $800 for a volunteer and stopped there before they called the cops in. Looking at it today if they offered someone $2k and avoided what happened, I'd say it's well worth it compared to the PR disaster. They'll pay millions to advertising firms for good marketing, $2k would be a drop in the bucket.

I have seen multiple crew members from different airlines fly with a competitor numerous times and airline companies have agreements in place for such arrangements (in another thread an airline employee said it was usually $100 a ticket flat and almost always washed out).

I'm an airline pilot, so I'll try and walk through why these options wouldn't have resolved anything:

1) This was a flight out of Chicago O'Hare Airport. Southwest does not operate out of there. They operate out of Midway Airport, which is almost a 30min drive away. No chance they could've gotten the 4 passengers over there in time to make the flight. They could've put them on an American flight, but no guarantees that even had open seats. The last few days have been brutal with the weather out east, so chances are there were very few seats available throughout the system. 

2) Almost everyone is bringing this up. And while this could be an option, some pilot unions have put clauses into their pilots contracts that forbid the use of ground transportation for deadhead travel. So while it seem like a good idea, it likely was not possible in this case.

3) From what I read they offered up to $1000. You could always offer more, but the problem is, if you haven limit on what you can offer, it can get really expensive, really fast. You have to cap it somewhere. And in the past, that has always worked. Obviously this particular instance is going to cost them a lot more, but usually it doesn't.

Obviously this was a giant  fuck up in how this was handled, but the reality was this is something that occurs almost every day, and when it comes down to it, passengers usually comply when told then have bene voluntarily bumped. Why couldn't someone else who had, even a little bit of flexibility, step up and say ""You know what, I'll bite the bullet so you can get home to your patients.""? That doesn't take the blame form United at all, but you'd think someone on that flight had at least a little flexibility.

[Let's use this image as a reference for the explanation. In this image, I've selected an expiration of April 13th, 2017 for UAL.](http://i.imgur.com/UcfUhoH.png)

An option contract is the ""option"" to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of the stock at the selected strike price at the time of the expiration. The value of the option that's ""in the money"" at expiration is the amount the actual share value is above(call)/below(put) your selected strike. Because you're basically leveraging your money 100x with each contract you buy, this allows the large returns I saw for a relatively minimal investment. I basically bought 100 shares of UAL for $61, and cashed in my realized gains on those 100 shares for $245.

Yesterday, when the story broke, UAL was up 1% so I assumed there would be a decent drop once it got out based on how quickly the story was spreading. A very good day followed by very bad news meant an over-correction was coming.

I bought a put contract with the strike price of $71 when the actual stock price was ~$71.75, which meant in order for me to make a profit and not lose my investment, the price would have to drop below $71. For each .01 below the strike price of $71, I would make a dollar on that contract at the time of sale (plus the premium from time value and implied volatility which I won't get into now). The risk with options is that the stock never goes ""in the money"", and your option expires completely worthless at it's expiration.

This morning when the market opened the stock price dropped to $68.60, so with my $71 strike price, the option at the time was worth ~$245 based on the bid at the time which was where I sold.

Why would UA rely on overbooked flights to move employees around?  Having staff at the their needed locations is a logistical issue that is entirely up to UA to solve.  Other airlines keep small fleets of private jets for just this purpose, why not UA?

UA already has a terrible staff morale problem, caused mainly by policies that force staff into situations exactly like this.  UA policies are hurting both staff and customer service.  This is a UA management level failure, all the way to the top.

Last minute schedule changes most likely. I've been the deadheading crew getting on a flight last minute before. It definitely happens. But like you said, the issue with my crew was taken care of in pre-boarding. I imagine what happened was the crew walked up after they had already started boarding.

Sorry, who is the ""us"", and what ethnicity are you? Genuinely confused, not trying to be pedantic or rile you up here :)



Anyway. As someone else mentioned, from the eyes of a white person all Asians probably look alike, what obvious physical characteristic is there to differentiate between each asian ethnicity? I'm Asian myself (living in the west) and I can never confidently claim to know where another asian came from ethnically just by looking. 



If United was discriminating against a vietnamese (purely because of the ethnicity) I'd automatically assume it was being *asianophobic* and targetting the vietnamese for being asian (as opposed to being vietnamese specifically).

This should have been an easy win. The US puts massive tariffs on China, while at the same time opening up more trade with Mexico, Canada, the EU, and other countries in the South Pacific. You create a huge trading bloc, with China sitting on the outside, and you burn them out economically.

Trump might be tough on China, but that's just because he's stupidly tough on everyone. China is the US (and the West's) biggest threat, and we needed to build a coalition to force China to be a respectful player on the world stage...instead, Trump just tossed a grenade onto the entire pile.

They also played footsie with democracy and capitalism just enough to keep the West hopeful.

It's pretty clear that all of that was just to cement their status in the world, and then pull a bait-and-switch move. Now that the West knows, and China is about to learn that the West knows...where do we go from here? China has a lot of nukes, the West has a lot of nukes...and I'm not seeing a lot of calm demeanor from the leaders of either country right now (with most of them pushing nationalism among the citizenry at the moment).

I (someone from the West) certainly don't hate anyone in China, and believe they have the same goals of having a good life, watching their children grow up safe, happy, and successful. I just think most governments in the West are pretty bad, and China's government is rotten to the core. It'd be a shame if we allow our governments to drag us all into a world war.

I think the craziest thing about China is that the CCP is hell-bent on keeping authoritarian control over their people, because they're paranoid about it all falling apart.

> U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted a new 2020 campaign video on Wednesday evening, which immediately sparked controversy for its purported use of a white supremacist logo at the end of the clip.

> Mediaite tracked the image back even further to a tweet by a self-described Dutch white nationalist, who Trump thanked for his support on Twitter in 2015, and whose Twitter account has since been suspended.

> Seth Mandel, the Executive Editor of Washington Examiner Magazine, replied, &quot;This is a bigger deal than ppl are going to make of it I think. This is taking his platform and signal boosting white supremacists and fascists. Yes, I know, he doesn&#039;t pay attention to this stuff, but so what? He should!

The article mentions Lion’s Guard’s stance in Ohio but that was an article about VDARE.

From the Lion Guard website: 

>	An informal civilian group dedicated to the safety and security of #Trump supporters by exposing Far-Left rioters.  We are the voluntary eyes and ears of Make America Great Again on Social Media.  We do not endorse instigating fights or brawling with anti-Trump marauders.  The Lion Guard seeks to identify and expose plots to attack Mr. Trump, Trump Supporters, and their rallies before they even can happen.

And the posts there did follow suit with this creed. 

Is the connection here that because various white nationalist from VDARE used the Lion Guard symbol that Trump ended up adopting for a campaign ad, that this was a wink and nod to white supremacists?

The second is the ongoing climate crisis, which many have proposed as a major cause of the Arab spring. It's the Arab spring and related events that saw a skyrocket of instability all across North Africa and the Middle East, from Libya to Syria to Yemen, and just like that we have a handful of new jihadist groups arising, a return of frequent Muslim terror attacks, and a wave of refugees.

A simple logic experiment based on realistic phenomena:

4chan kid 1 suspects government agents (or something? russians? corporations trying to sell fortnite coins?) are seeding posts and otherwise swaying discussion in /pol/ in service to various agendas. Some number of narratives there are anomalous in the zeitgeist of 4chan logic from his perspective, especially when contrasted with the demonstrably natural group dynamics of earlier 4chan, so he's pretty confident some sort of bamboozle is occurring even without evidence and there's not actually much incentive not to suggest as such whether or not he's correct.

4chan kid 2 thinks it's ridiculous to humor such an idea without hard evidence, especially since he's predisposed to conflate that sort of logic with anti-intellectualism and alt-right themes owing to the efforts of 4chan kid 3, who is actually a contractor working on behalf of the government, russia, fortnite, and beyonce's pr team.

4chan kid 3 only needs to subtly manipulate 4chan kid 2 (and his like) to maintain plausible deniability, and thus a cognitive blind spot develops memetically that further establishes his ability to work unabated, all thanks to 4chan kid 2's incomplete skepticism.

If we listen to 4chan kids 2 and 3 we flat out *can't* do anything about it. If we listen to 4chan kid 1 (who inferred the situation intuitively from context clues) there's at least a chance they could free themselves from the whims of cynical manipulators.",PantsGrenades,1,1567117670.0,eyj1onp

He said multiple times (and twatted it), not just once and multiple people misheard it.  Bigly actually makes a lot more sense than big-league which just goes to show you how stupid this all is.  I, for one, am fine mocking him any way possible and it does seem fitting in a way to go after him for something he didn't even say.  Sound familiar?

But the university later retracted the statement, saying Hawking had withdrawn from the Israeli Presidential Conference because of ill health. ""Professor Hawking will not be attending the conference in Israel in June for health reasons. His doctors have advised against him flying,"" a university spokesman said in an email.
Earlier, the same spokesman reported that Hawking had approved a statement posted by the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine, which said he had decided to boycott the event ""based upon his knowledge of Palestine"".

>>Professor Stephen Hawking: The attack on Gaza is similar to that on Lebanon two years ago, that killed over two thousand but did not achieve Israel's war aims. I think the assault on Gaza will be equally unsuccessful. A people under occupation will continue to resist in any way it can. If Israel wants peace it will have to talk to Hamas like Britain did with the IRA. Hamas is the democratically elected leaders of the Palestinian people and cannot be ignored. 

>>Riz Khan: Professor what have been your thoughts during the three weeks of violence that has taken place in Gaza?

From the Start, Trump Has Muddied a Clear Message: Putin Interfered

By David E. Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg

WASHINGTON — Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.

The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.

Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.

The shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.

On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin’s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.

On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, “Is Russia still targeting the U.S.?” Mr. Trump shot back, “No” — directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)

Hours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, “because he’s in charge of the country.”

In the run-up to this week’s ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.

The Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.

The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the “Steele dossier.” That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump’s activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.

According to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin’s role in the election interference.

They included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U. had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.

And ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin’s own role.

That included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.

Instead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.

Mr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.

The same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called “hand-to-hand combat” to dig in.

The pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.

After the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said “Russia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries” were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations — including the D.N.C.

Still, Mr. Trump said in his statement, “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.”

Mr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.

“I was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,” he said in testimony in May 2017. “And they were very aggressive.”

For Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.

Mr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton’s loss in the election.

Mr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia’s election interference.

Only Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)

And the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.

In March, the Department of Homeland Security declared that Russia was targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.

Just last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were “blinking red” and called Russia the “most aggressive foreign actor, no question.”

“And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,” he said.

Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm.

“The intelligence community’s assessment has not changed,” Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. “My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.”

The Russian efforts are “aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,” he continued. “We haven’t yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.”

“It’s a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.”

Almost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia’s election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.

He dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a “witch hunt” against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia’s role — and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump’s immediate orbit may have worked with them.

In July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow’s cyberskills were so good that the government’s hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.

Since then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure — as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday — he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.

That is what happened again this week, twice.

Mr. Trump’s statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.

That contributed to Mr. Trump’s decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered — although he also veered off script to declare: “Could be other people also. A lot of people out there.”

> **Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.**
> 
> **The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin,** who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.
> 
> **Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced**, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own **intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.**

Trump has known since 14 days before his Inauguration that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the attacks on our elections. He has obfuscated and denied and covered for Putin for 558 days.

And Trump still has yet to directly state that Putin ordered the attack. The closest he has come is saying that Putin would be responsible as leader of his country (as covered in the article).

This is watershed. Trump is failing to serve America's best interest, and this behavior alone should rise to being an impeachable defense. No previous President in history would have survived aiding a foreign power in this way.

From what I've read from you guys I can gather protesting is just useless, though I dont think it is because protesting itself doesn't work, but because they have made sure you guys can't use it for anything. You can't leave work, and if you do go out and protest police gets involved and it turns violent, and even if that doesn't scare you, your protests aren't listened to and go unnoticed. 
I still think this should be addressed as, sometimes, voting fails. It is verified now that Putin meddled with the elections and he could very well keep messing in the future, and if your vote doesn't work, what do you have left?

Bill Browder is the reason the Magnitsky Act was enacted.^[[1]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/14/the-magnitsky-act-explained/?utm_term=.0f0d17c7dfc2) Sanctions against Russian Oligarchs allied with President Vladimir Putin were enacted specifically to put pressure on Putin's authoritative style of governance.^[[2]](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/magnitsky-act-kremlin/535044/) Putin cares about these sanctions because they hurt the relationships he's cultivated with corrupt, powerful officials in the country.^[[3]](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/13/the-putin-obsession-that-led-to-trump-jrs-meeting-215374) The Magnitsky Act was discussed at the now infamous Trump Tower Meeting.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-tower-veselnitskaya-russia.html)

I recommend watching Bill Browder's recent Senate Congressional testimony. He paints an incredible picture of how the Russian government operates and provides a motive for the Russians to work with the Trump campaign.^[[5]](https://www.c-span.org/video/?431852-1/william-browder-overturning-magnitsky-act-putins-top-priority)

If you would like the read the legislation to get a better idea of what the Magnistky Act is here you go;

H.R.6156 - Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012^[[6]](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/6156)

S.284 - Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act of 2015/2016^[[7]](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/284)


**June 9, 2016 - A month before candidate Trump publicly asked for help from a foreign adversary, his surrogates met with Russian operatives at the now infamous Trump Tower meeting. They discussed the Magnistky Act. One operative has ties to Russian intelligence and has been accused of hacking.**

One of the Russian operatives, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is an outspoken opponent of the Magnitsky Act.^[[8]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html) Trump Jr. admitted to discussing adoptions, which means they discussed Russian sanctions. Moreover, in 2017 at the G20 summit Putin and Trump discussed adoptions and the Magnitsky Act.^[[9]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40673583) The other Russian operative present at the infamous Trump Tower meeting, Rinat Akhmetshin, has ties to Russian intelligence and has a history of being embroiled in  court cases related to hacking campaigns.^[[10]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/us/rinat-akhmetshin-russia-trump-meeting.html?referer=)

>He has an association with a former deputy head of a Russian spy service, the F.S.B., and a history of working for close allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Twice, he has worked on legal battles for Russian tycoons whose opponents suffered sophisticated hacking attacks, arousing allegations of computer espionage.

>The Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 took place less than a week before revelations that hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee’s computers and obtained a trove of emails. Investigators have traced digital espionage to Russian spy agencies. 

>During the same period that Mr. Akhmetshin was accused of being involved in various hacking schemes, he appears to have been nurturing a relationship with Viktor Ivanov, once the deputy head of Russia’s intelligence service, the F.S.B., and until last year a top aide to Mr. Putin.

**July 27, 2016 Candidate Trump looked directly at the camera and publicly asked Russia for their help to find Hillary Clinton's missing emails, the Russian military intelligence (GRU) hacked Clinton thereafter.**

During a campaign rally in Florida on July 27, 2016, President Trump called on Russia to help him find Hillary Clinton's missing 30,000 emails.^[[11]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) Special Counsel Mueller's new indictment against 12 Russian Intelligence Officers found that on July 27, 2016 Russian hackers known as Guccifer 2.0 hacked Hillary Clinton's emails.^[[12]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)

*DoJ Indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers Pg. 7 - 8*

>The Conspirators spearphished individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign throughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a thirdparty provider and used by Clinton’s personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign. 

**August 22, 2017 Senate Intelligence Committee Testimony that the Trump campaign accepted regular intelligence from the Kremlin during the 2016 campaign**

The Senate Judiciary committee testimony of Fusion GPS CEO Glenn Simpson confirms that the Trump campaign likely received foreign intelligence aid during the 2016 campaign.^[[13]](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf)

*Pg. 154 - 155 Senate Judiciary Committee Testimony*

>A. I mean, one of the key lines here in the second paragraph says ""However, he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals."" So the issue with the Trump Tower meeting, as 1 I understand it, is that the Trump people were eager to accept intelligence from a foreign government about their political rivals and that is, you know, I would say, a form of interference. If you're getting help from a foreign government and your help is intelligence, then the foreign government's interfering. I mean, you know, I think that also -- of course, in retrospect we now know this was pretty right on target in terms on what it says. So anyway --

>Q. In reference to you think that particular sentence?

>A. I mean, it clearly refers to, you know, them being interested in and willing to -- it depicts them as accepting information. What we have seen to date with the disclosures this year is they were at a minimum super interested in getting information.

>Q. And when you're referencing the ""disclosures this year,"" could you just be specific about that.

>A. The Trump Tower meeting.

>Q. So with reference to the June 9th Trump Tower meeting?

>A. Yes. Yes.

Misinformation is simply the downside of the internet revolution but before we as a society learned to understand and mitigate it. 

For example, you couldn't get into a 30mph+ accident before cars came along. Then you could. But even after that, there were decades where cars went well over 30mph and it was just accepted that a cars will have high speed accidents and kill people. It wasn't until the 1950ish that safety features were even thought about. Crumple zones, seat belts, collapsible steering columns. Then it took another 30 years until the 80s for it to be implimented as law into all vehicles.

Misinformation is the car crashes of the internet and we are at a time when we accept that access to information will naturally come with access to misinformation and scams. One day we will mitigate and regulate misinformation.

If the enhancement is because they require 2 or more people for care or take over 20 minutes, we are supposed to get extra hours for another aide to come in for every 2-3 enhancements of that type.

This happened when we had our old executive director. He has his BSN, and knows what it is like to be on the floor. He also was willing to have those difficult conversations with family when it was time for a resident to move to skilled, geripsych, or hospice. We had very few injuries. 

Both my manager and current executive director have no experience on the floor and are nonconfrontational. They will do nothing, unless you make their life miserable enough that having a difficult conversation with family is the least painful path forward. With extra load on staff, we have had a ridiculous amount of injuries because of the pressure to get care done by a certain time.

So I just direct my staff to call them in when a 3-4 person transfer has a huge mess, because we can't afford to have all the aides off the floor for 30-40 minutes. My manager and executive director always say they aren't strong enough to support the resident,  so I always hand them gloves, a washcloth, and point to the soapy water.

I would guess that we have $25-40k/mo in enhancement fees, but it seems to go everywhere but the place it needs to go to solve the problem.  My manager is also wanting to drop 16 aide hours a day because she hires the wrong people and her training budget is way over  the annual allowance by the first quarter.

Not saying that Bill Curry is a sell-out (his articles supporting Bernie definitely seem truthful), but be careful with what you read, and vote accordingly.  If you want Hillary to win over Trump, do not want to vote for her, and live in a red state like Oklahoma, you're pretty safe voting third party.  You can vote Democrat down-ballot.

""What's your other option? Vote Trump?"". ""Stop taking an idiotic position demanding <thing that was promised to you>, it's not gonna happen"".

You will never have your voice heard with people like this. If you know *ANYONE* who supported Sanders in the past, show them this thread. Remind them that their voice is worthless. They view Bernie as an old fool who can be duped and scared into signing over his entire voter base over to the HRC Machine - thanks to the Trump bogeyman.

They were terrified of a rule of the people because they realized that political power in the hands of the people would be a threat to their wealth and property- the people would clamor for an equitable distribution. The US has always been dominated by an oligarchy of capital. 

Madison:
The man who is possessed of wealth, who lolls on his sofa or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge the wants or feelings of the day-laborer. The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed interest, at present, is prevalent; but in process of time, when we approximate to the states and kingdoms of Europe, — when the number of landholders shall be comparatively small, through the various means of trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in future elections, and unless wisely provided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. ",naufrag,62,1478539247.0,d9pobr2

People are being attacked and being threatened with an accusation of racism / sexism or immorality - if they don't vote for her. This is completely absurd.

You are right people have the right to be assholes, and attack others for their voting decisions. But it doesn't change the fact that you are being an asshole. And more then likely, you ended up pushing people away from your view point.

Biggest issue I have with Hillary supporters, is that they want to ignore all the problems she has. They want people to see her as this beacon of hope, this great leader of integrity and experience. They want to turn a blind eye to all the horrible shit tied to her, and also sweep under the rug that she and the DNC cheated in the primaries - and suppressed the very same voters you are now yelling at to get in line and vote for the people that suppressed them.

This isn't a convincing argument. This is a big reason Bernies call to supporters to just back her, has failed. If he had addressed Clnton and the DNC cheating more actively, as well as all the issues she has tied to her - and we will hold her accountable after she wins - then I think more people could see the lesser of two evil arguments. But he's largely stayed silent on things, and just expect people to support her.

Clinton supporters have also done the same thing. But given everything, that isn't good enough. And attacking people for not voting the way you want, isn't going to cut it either.

**Edit:**

What I mean is, if you are going to make the argument that people should vote for Hillary because Trump is infinitely worse - then at least be honest with people that don't like her for various reasons. Especially Sanders supporters that have very legitimate reasons to dislike her.

Simply using the ""lesser of two evil arguments"" while also praising her and ignoring the concerns and criticisms people have with her, reeks of not giving a fuck about others concerns or point of view. And if you don't give a fuck, then don't expect others to give a fuck.

Clinton supporters have honestly been some of the worst I've ever seen. The amount of bullying and guilt tripping has been ridiculous. Simply saying Trump is the worst thing ever, and yeah Clinton has some major issues, the DNC is fucked, and primaries were not acceptable - but let's keep Trump out of the White House and we'll also work to address these other serious issues.

Instead, she went hard left, along with the party, at the convention, and is running on tax increases for the wealthy, aggressive environmental policy, free public college education for those making less than six figures.

If we reward her by giving her our support, she will have a progressive mandate and the Democratic Party will have proof that it can move left and compete nationally.

If we stay home or jump ship to third parties? They'll never give us this opportunity again, at least not for years.

I've talked to people who think that ANY amount of manipulation, by the media, by their party of choice, and by their candidate, is to be tolerated over trump. Look at this list of shit CNN has tried to pull this election:

1. [CNN would rather give you a sappy heartwarming LIE than admit this woman wants violence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-8Cn6boqcA&feature=youtu.be)

2. [CNN and Anderson Cooper lie about past reporting they've done, and pretend that audio of Hillary cackling on about a child rape case is somehow ""not authenticated""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpwPwhvabi8&feature=youtu.be)

3. [Here's CNN's Don Lemon doing the god damned EXACT SAME THING.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?)

4. [Here's CNN pretending that looking at Wikileaks is illegal... But it's ok for them to do it... because they're the media...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-beYBLrkNAg)

5. [Here's CNN coaching their ""focus group"" on what to say after the debate... because FUCK THE TRUTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqCIub3SmCI)

6. [CNN doesn't want to tell us what Trump *actually said*, so they'll just doctor his tweets and make shit up. No big deal right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Eps97Mp_s)
7. [It's always so unfortunate when technical issues cause cuts in feed every time someone say something bad about Hillary... especially when they were with Bernie till the end!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYRN8Clddw)

8. [Of course they would employ Donna Brazile, head of the fucking DNC, who is happy to pass along debate questions to Hillary. At least until she got caught...](http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/31/donna-brazile-shared-additional-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign-identified-her-tipster/)

9. [And then the same thing happened for Wolf Blitzer. In fact, CNN got every fucking DNC staffer's input on what questions they would like this ""impartial objective news service"" to ask Trump](http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/06/wikileaks-emails-cnn-asked-dnc-for-questions-for-interviews-with-trump-cruz/)


Again, all this shit happened in the last 2 months, and this is from ONE ORGANIZATION.


So yea, the fact that CNN has any viewers left after this disgrace, along with the Daily Beast and Huffpo (Which employed convicted felon Bob Creamer who was just fired for widespread election fraud), is a testament to how much lying people are willing to tolerate and endorse... because Hillary Clinton must. just. be. that. damn. good.",joepa_knew,30,1478560519.0,d9q4n3e

Davis has two daughters from her first marriage and twins, a son and another daughter, who were born five months after her divorce from her first husband.[184] Her third husband is the biological father of the twins.

> Though Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted there had been &quot;Communication,&quot; aides privately conceded the phone calls Trump described didn&#039;t happen they way he said they did.

> &quot;I can tell you clearly that I haven&#039;t heard of such a thing.&quot; And it may indicate why the president was so hesitant to offer any detail on said calls, instead telling reporters, &quot;We have had calls at the highest level, but I don&#039;t want to talk about that.&quot; Could it be that Trump was genuinely confused about communications coming from China? Sure.
